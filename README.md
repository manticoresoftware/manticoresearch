**❗Read recent [blog post about Manticore vs Elasticsearch](https://manticoresearch.com/blog/manticore-alternative-to-elasticsearch/)❗**

Manticore Search is an easy to use open source fast database for search. Good alternative for Elasticsearch. What distinguishes it from other solutions is:
* It's very fast and therefore more cost-efficient than alternatives, for example Manticore is:
  - **182x faster** than MySQL for [small data](https://db-benchmarks.com/test-hn-small/#mysql-vs-manticore-search) ([reproducible](https://github.com/db-benchmarks/db-benchmarks#get-started)❗)
  - **29x faster** than Elasticsearch for [log analytics](https://db-benchmarks.com/test-logs10m/#elasticsearch-with-no-tuning-vs-manticore-search-default-row-wise-storage) ([reproducible](https://github.com/db-benchmarks/db-benchmarks#get-started)❗)
  - **15x faster** than Elasticsearch for [small dataset](https://db-benchmarks.com/test-hn-small/#manticore-search-vs-elasticsearch) ([reproducible](https://github.com/db-benchmarks/db-benchmarks#get-started)❗)
  - **5x faster** than Elasticsearch for [medium-size data](https://db-benchmarks.com/test-hn/#manticore-search-columnar-storage-vs-elasticsearch) ([reproducible](https://github.com/db-benchmarks/db-benchmarks#get-started)❗)
  - **4x faster** than Elasticsearch for [big data](https://db-benchmarks.com/test-taxi/#manticore-search-vs-elasticsearch) ([reproducible](https://github.com/db-benchmarks/db-benchmarks#get-started)❗)
  - **up to 2x faster** max throughput than Elasticsearch's for data ingestion on a single server ([reproducible](https://manticoresearch.com/blog/manticore-alternative-to-elasticsearch/#data-ingestion-performance)❗)
* With its modern multithreading architecture and efficient query parallelization capabilities, Manticore is able to fully utilize all your CPU cores to achieve the quickest response times possible.
* The powerful and speedy full-text search works seamlessly with both small and large datasets.
* Row-wise storage for small, medium and big size datasets.
* For even larger datasets, Manticore offers columnar storage support through the [Manticore Columnar Library](https://github.com/manticoresoftware/columnar/), capable of handling datasets too big to fit in RAM.
* Performant secondary indexes are automatically created, saving you time and effort.
* The cost-based query optimizer optimizes search queries for optimal performance.
* Manticore is SQL-first, utilizing SQL as its native syntax, and offers compatibility with the MySQL protocol, allowing you to use your preferred MySQL client.
* With clients available in [PHP](https://github.com/manticoresoftware/manticoresearch-php), [Python](https://github.com/manticoresoftware/manticoresearch-python), [JavaScript](https://github.com/manticoresoftware/manticoresearch-javascript), [Typescript](https://github.com/manticoresoftware/manticoresearch-typescript), [Java](https://github.com/manticoresoftware/manticoresearch-java), [Elixir](https://github.com/manticoresoftware/manticoresearch-elixir), and [Go](https://github.com/manticoresoftware/manticoresearch-go), integration with Manticore Search becomes easy.
* Manticore also provides a programmatic HTTP JSON protocol for more versatile data and schema management.
* Built in C++, Manticore Search starts quickly and uses minimal RAM, with low-level optimizations contributing to its impressive performance.
* With real-time inserts, newly added documents are immediately accessible.
* Interactive courses are available through [Interactive courses](https://play.manticoresearch.com/) to make learning a breeze.
* Manticore also boasts built-in replication and load balancing for added reliability.
* Data can be synced from sources such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, ODBC, xml, and csv with ease.
* While not fully ACID-compliant, Manticore still supports transactions and binlog to ensure safe writes.
* Effortless data backup and recovery with built-in tools and SQL commands

[Craigslist](https://www.craigslist.org/), [Socialgist](https://socialgist.com/), [PubChem](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/), [Rozetka](https://rozetka.com.ua/) and many others use Manticore for efficient searching and stream filtering.

Manticore Search was forked from [Sphinx 2.3.2](https://github.com/sphinxsearch/sphinx) in 2017.

# Installation

### Docker
Docker image is available on [Docker Hub](https://dockr.ly/33biV0U).

To experiment with Manticore Search in Docker just run:

```
docker run -e EXTRA=1 --name manticore --rm -d manticoresearch/manticore && until docker logs manticore 2>&1 | grep -q "accepting connections"; do sleep 1; done && docker exec -it manticore mysql && docker stop manticore
```

You can then: create a table, add data and run searches. For example:

```
create table movies(title text, year int) morphology='stem_en' html_strip='1' stopwords='en';

insert into movies(title, year) values ('The Seven Samurai', 1954), ('Bonnie and Clyde', 1954), ('Reservoir Dogs', 1992), ('Airplane!', 1980), ('Raging Bull', 1980), ('Groundhog Day', 1993), ('<a href="http://google.com/">Jurassic Park</a>', 1993), ('Ferris Bueller\'s Day Off', 1986);

select highlight(), year from movies where match('the dog');

select highlight(), year from movies where match('days') facet year;

select * from movies where match('google');
```

Note that upon exiting the MySQL client, the Manticore container will be stopped and removed, resulting in no saved data, so **use this way only for testing / sandboxing purposes**.
