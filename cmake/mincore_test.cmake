# Mincore char test
# --------------
#
# Test whether function 'mincore' accept 3-rd param as char* or unsigned char*
#
# This piece of code is runaround and exists untill mincore is in use.
# It is much more better to refactor 'crashdump' func in the code and move
# all the stuff about dumping current query to the very end, after
# all another significant info is collected. This way it will be
# not so important whether we dump the query or not at all, and so,
# no mincore check will be necessary.
#
# For now the problem is that prototype is different on linux/bsd,
# and so, this special testing is necessary to successfully compile.
