=Sphinx Client Library 0.1.0

This document gives an overview of what is Sphinx itself and how to use in 
within Ruby on Rails. For more information or documentation, 
please go to http://www.sphinxsearch.com

==Sphinx

Sphinx is a standalone full-text search engine, meant to provide fast, 
size-efficient and relevant fulltext search functions to other applications. 
Sphinx was specially designed to integrate well with SQL databases and 
scripting languages. Currently built-in data sources support fetching data 
either via direct connection to MySQL, or from an XML pipe.
 
Simplest way to communicate with Sphinx is to use <tt>searchd</tt> -
a daemon to search through fulltext indices from external software.
