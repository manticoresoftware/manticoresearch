   A. Sphinx revision history

1. Introduction
===============

1.1. About
----------

Sphinx is a full-text search engine, distributed under GPL version 2.
Commercial licensing (eg. for embedded use) is also available upon request.

Generally, it's a standalone search engine, meant to provide fast,
size-efficient and relevant full-text search functions to other
applications. Sphinx was specially designed to integrate well with SQL
databases and scripting languages.

Currently built-in data source drivers support fetching data either via
direct connection to MySQL, or PostgreSQL, or from a pipe in a custom XML
format. Adding new drivers (eg. to natively support some other DBMS) is
designed to be as easy as possible.

Search API is natively ported to PHP, Python, Perl and Ruby and also
available as a pluggable MySQL storage engine. API is very lightweight so
porting it to new language is known to take a few hours.

As for the name, Sphinx is an acronym which is officially decoded as SQL
Phrase Index. Yes, I know about CMU's Sphinx project.

1.2. Sphinx features
--------------------

   * high indexing speed (upto 10 MB/sec on modern CPUs);
   * high search speed (avg query is under 0.1 sec on 2-4 GB text
     collections);
   * high scalability (upto 100 GB of text, upto 100 M documents on
     a single CPU);
   * provides good relevance ranking through combination of phrase
     proximity ranking and statistical (BM25) ranking;
   * provides distributed searching capabilities;
   * provides document exceprts generation;
   * provides searching from within MySQL through pluggable storage engine;
   * supports boolean, phrase, and word proximity queries;
   * supports multiple full-text fields per document (upto 32 by default);
   * supports multiple additional attributes per document (ie. groups,
     timestamps, etc);
   * supports stopwords;
   * supports both single-byte encodings and UTF-8;
   * supports English stemming, Russian stemming, and Soundex for
     morphology;
   * supports MySQL natively (MyISAM and InnoDB tables are both supported);
   * supports PostgreSQL natively.

1.3. Where to get Sphinx
------------------------

Sphinx is available through its official Web site at
http://www.sphinxsearch.com/.

Currently, Sphinx distribution tarball includes the following software:

   * indexer: an utility which creates fulltext indexes;
   * search: a simple command-line (CLI) test utility which searches
     through fulltext indexes;
   * searchd: a daemon which enables external software (eg. Web
     applications) to search through fulltext indexes;
   * sphinxapi: a set of searchd client API libraries for popular Web
     scripting languages (PHP, Python, Perl, Ruby).

1.5. Author and contributors
----------------------------

Author
------

Sphinx initial author and current primary developer is:

   * Andrew Aksyonoff, <shodan(at)shodan.ru>

Contributors
------------

People who contributed to Sphinx and their contributions (in no particular
order) are:

   * Robert "coredev" Bengtsson (Sweden), initial version of PostgreSQL
     data source;
   * Len Kranendonk, Perl API
   * Dmytro Shteflyuk, Ruby API

Many other people have contributed ideas, bug reports, fixes, etc. Thank
you!

1.6. History
------------

Sphinx development was started back in 2001, because I didn't manage to
find an acceptable search solution (for a database driven Web site) which
would meet my requirements. Actually, each and every important aspect was
a problem:

   * search quality (ie. good relevance)

      * statistical ranking methods performed rather bad, especially on
        large collections of small documents (forums, blogs, etc)

   * search speed

      * especially if searching for phrases which contain stopwords, as in
        "to be or not to be"

   * moderate disk and CPU requirements when indexing

      * important in shared hosting enivronment, not to mention the
        indexing speed.

Despite the amount of time passed and numerous improvements made in the
other solutions, there's still no solution which I personally would be
eager to migrate to.

Considering that and a lot of positive feedback received from Sphinx users
during last years, the obvious decision is to continue developing Sphinx
(and, eventually, to take over the world).

2. Installation
===============

2.1. Supported systems
----------------------

Most modern UNIX systems with a C++ compiler should be able to compile and
run Sphinx without any modifications.

Currently known systems Sphinx has been successfully running on are:

   * Linux 2.4.x, 2.6.x (various distributions)
   * Windows 2000, XP
   * FreeBSD 4.x, 5.x, 6.x
   * NetBSD 1.6
   * Solaris 9
   * Mac OS X

I hope Sphinx will work on other Unix platforms as well. If the platform
you run Sphinx on is not in this list, please do report it.

At the moment, Windows version of Sphinx's searchd daemon is not intended
to be used in production because it can only handle one client at a time.

2.2. Required tools
-------------------

On UNIX, you will need the following tools to build and install Sphinx:

   * a working C++ compiler. GNU gcc is known to work.
   * a good make program. GNU make is known to work.

On Windows, you will need Microsoft Visual C/C++ Studio .NET 2003 or 2005.
Other compilers/environments will probably work as well, but for the time
being, you will have to build makefile (or other environment specific
project files) manually.

2.3. Installing Sphinx
----------------------

   1. Extract everything from the distribution tarball (haven't you
      already?) and go to the sphinx subdirectory:

      | $ tar xzvf sphinx-0.9.7.tar.gz
      | $ cd sphinx

   2. Run the configuration program:

      | $ ./configure

      There's a number of options to configure. The complete listing may be
      obtained by using --help switch. The most important ones are:

      * --prefix, which specifies where to install Sphinx;
      * --with-mysql, which specifies where to look for MySQL include and
        library files, if auto-detection fails;
      * --with-pgsql, which specifies where to look for PostgreSQL include
        and library files.

   3. Build the binaries:

      | $ make

   4. Install the binaries in the directory of your choice:

      | $ make install

2.4. Known installation issues
------------------------------

If configure fails to locate MySQL headers and/or libraries, try checking
for and installing mysql-devel package. On some systems, it is not
installed by default.

If make fails with a message which look like

   | /bin/sh: g++: command not found
   | make[1]: *** [libsphinx_a-sphinx.o] Error 127

try checking for and installing gcc-c++ package.

If you are getting compile-time errors which look like

   | sphinx.cpp:67: error: invalid application of `sizeof' to
   |     incomplete type `Private::SizeError<false>'

this means that some compile-time type size check failed. The most probable
reason is that off_t type is less than 64-bit on your system. As a quick
hack, you can edit sphinx.h and replace off_t with DWORD in a typedef for
SphOffset_t, but note that this will prohibit you from using full-text
indexes larger than 2 GB. Even if the hack helps, please report such
issues, providing the exact error message and compiler/OS details, so
I could properly fix them in next releases.

If you keep getting any other error, or the suggestions above do not seem
to help you, please don't hesitate to contact me.

2.5. Quick Sphinx usage tour
----------------------------

All the example commands below assume that you installed Sphinx in
/usr/local/sphinx.

To use Sphinx, you will need to:

   1. Create a configuration file.

      Default configuration file name is sphinx.conf. All Sphinx programs
      look for this file in current working directory by default.

      Sample configuration file, sphinx.conf.dist, which has all the
      options documented, is created by configure. Copy and edit that
      sample file to make your own configuration:

      | $ cd /usr/local/sphinx/etc
      | $ cp sphinx.conf.dist sphinx.conf
      | $ vi sphinx.conf

      Sample configuration file is setup to index documents table from
      MySQL database test; so there's example.sql sample data file to
      populate that table with a few documents for testing purposes:

      | $ mysql -u test < /usr/local/sphinx/etc/example.sql

   2. Run the indexer to create full-text index from your data:

      | $ cd /usr/local/sphinx/etc
      | $ /usr/local/sphinx/bin/indexer

   3. Query your newly created index!

To query the index from command line, use search utility:

   | $ cd /usr/local/sphinx/etc
   | $ /usr/local/sphinx/bin/search test

To query the index from your PHP scripts, you need to:

   1. Run the search daemon which your script will talk to:

      | $ cd /usr/local/sphinx/etc
      | $ /usr/local/sphinx/bin/searchd

   2. Run the attached PHP API test script (to ensure that the daemon was
      succesfully started and is ready to serve the queries):

      | $ cd sphinx/api
      | $ php test.php test

   3. Include the API (it's located in api/sphinxapi.php) into your own
      scripts and use it.

Happy searching!

3. Indexing
===========

3.1. Data sources
-----------------

The data to be indexed can generally come from very different sources: SQL
databases, plain text files, HTML files, mailboxes, and so on. From Sphinx
point of view, the data it indexes is a set of structured documents, each
of which has the same set of fields. This is biased towards SQL, where each
row correspond to a document, and each column to a field.

Depending on what source Sphinx should get the data from, different code is
required to fetch the data and prepare it for indexing. This code is called
data source driver (or simply driver or data source for brevity).

At the time of this writing, there are drivers for MySQL and PostgreSQL
databases, which can connect to the database using its native C/C++ API,
run queries and fetch the data. There's also a driver called XMLpipe, which
runs a specified command and reads the data from its stdout. See
Section 3.7, <<XMLpipe data source>> section for the format description.

There can be as many sources per index as necessary. They will be
sequentially processed in the very same order which was specifed in index
definition. All the documents coming from those sources will be merged as
if they were coming from a single source.

3.2. Attributes
---------------

It is often needed to do some additional processing of full-text search
results depending not only on matching document ID and weight, but on
a number of other per-document values as well. For instance, one might need
to sort news search results by date and then relevance, or search through
products within specified price range, or limit blog search to posts made
by selected users, or group results by month.

To do that efficiently, Sphinx allows to attach a number of additional
attributes to each document, and stores their values when indexing. These
values may then be used to filter, sort, or group full-text matches when
searching.

A good example would be a forum posts table. Assume that 'title' and
'content' fields need to be full-text searchable, but it is also needed to
optionally limit searching to some author or sub-forum (ie. specific values
of 'author_id' or 'forum_id'), or to sort matches by 'post_date', or to
group matching posts by month of the 'post_date' and calculate per-group
match counts.

This can be achieved by specifying all the mentioned columns (excluding
'title' and 'content' which are full-text fields) as attributes and then
using API calls to setup filtering, sorting, and grouping. Here as an
example.

Example sphinx.conf part:
-------------------------

   | ...
   | sql_query = SELECT id, title, content, \
   | 	author_id, forum_id, post_date FROM my_forum_posts
   | sql_group_column = author_id
   | sql_group_column = forum_id
   | sql_date_column = post_date
   | ...

Example application code (in PHP):
----------------------------------

   | // only search posts by author whose ID is 123
   | $cl->SetFilter ( "author_id", array ( 123 ) );
   | 
   | // only search posts in sub-forums 1, 3 and 7
   | $cl->SetFilter ( "forum_id", array ( 1,3,7 ) );
   | 
   | // sort found posts by posting date in descending order
   | $cl->SetSortMode ( SPH_SORT_ATTR_DESC, "post_date" );

Attributes are named. Attribute names are case insensitive.

Attributes are not full-text indexed; they are stored in the index as is.

Currently supported attribute types are:

   * 32-bit unsigned integer,
   * UNIX timestamp.

Attribute values are currently internally stored as fixed-size 4-byte
values. A set of all per-document attribute values is called docinfo.
Docinfos can either be

   * stored separately ("extern" storage in .spa file), or
   * attached to each occurence of document ID in full-text index data
     ("inline" storage in .spd file).

Externally stored docinfo is kept in RAM when searching. Thus "inline" may
be the only viable option for huge (50-100+ million documents) datasets
because of limited RAM size. However, for smaller datasets "extern" storage
makes both indexing and searching much more efficient.

Additional search-time memory requirements for extern storage are
(1+number_of_attrs)*number_of_docs*4 bytes, ie. 10 million docs with
2 groups and 1 timestamp will take (1+2+1)*10M*4 = 160 MB of RAM. This is
PER DAEMON, ie. searchd will alloc 160 MB on startup, read the data and
keep it shared between queries; the children will NOT allocate additional
copies of this data.

3.3. Indexes
------------

To be able to answer full-text search queries fast, Sphinx needs to build
a special data structure optimized for such queries from your text data.
This structure is called index; and the process of building index from text
is called indexing.

Different index types are well suited for different tasks. For example,
a disk-based tree-based index would be easy to update (ie. insert new
documents to existing index), but rather slow to search. Therefore, Sphinx
architecture allows for different index types to be implemented easily.

The only index type which is implemented in Sphinx at the moment is
designed for maximum indexing and searching speed. This comes at a cost of
updates being really slow; theoretically, it might be slower to update this
type of index than than to reindex it from scratch. However, this very
frequently could be worked around with muiltiple indexes, see Section 3.8,
<<Live index updates>> for details.

It is planned to implement more index types, including the type which would
be updateable in real time.

There can be as many indexes per configuration file as necessary. indexer
utility can reindex either all of them (if --all option is specified), or
a certain explicitly specified subset. searchd utility will serve all the
specified indexes, and the clients can specify what indexes to search in
run time.

3.4. Restrictions on the source data
------------------------------------

There are a few different restrictions imposed on the source data which is
going to be indexed by Sphinx, of which the single most important one is:

ALL DOCUMENT IDS MUST BE UNIQUE UNSIGNED NON-ZERO 32-BIT INTEGER NUMBERS.

If this requirement is not met, different bad things can happen. For
instance, Sphinx can crash with an internal assertion while indexing; or
produce strange results when searching due to conflicting IDs. Also,
a 1000-pound gorilla might eventually come out of your display and start
throwing barrels at you. You've been warned.

3.5. Charsets, case folding, and translation tables
---------------------------------------------------

When indexing some index, Sphinx fetches documents from the specified
sources, splits the text into words, and does case folding so that "Abc",
"ABC" and "abc" would be treated as the same word (or, to be pedantic,
term).

To do that properly, Sphinx needs to know

   * what encoding is the source text in;
   * what characters are letters and what are not;
   * what letters should be folded to what letters.

This should be configured on a per-index basis using charset_type and
charset_table options. With charset_type, one would specify whether the
document encoding is single-byte (SBCS) or UTF-8. charset_table would then
be used to specify the table which maps letter characters to their case
folded versions. The characters which are not in the table are considered
to be non-letters and will be treated as word separators when indexing or
searching through this index.

Note that while default tables do not include space character (ASCII code
0x20, Unicode U+0020) as a letter, it's in fact perfectly legal to do so.
This can be useful, for instance, for indexing tag clouds, so that
space-separated word sets would index as a single search query term.

Default tables currently include English and Russian characters. Please do
submit your tables for other languages!

3.6. SQL data sources (MySQL, PostgreSQL)
-----------------------------------------

With all the SQL drivers, indexing generally works as follows.

   * connection to the database is established;
   * pre-query (see Section 7.1.10, <<sql_query_pre>>) is executed to
     perform any necessary initial setup, such as setting per-connection
     encoding with MySQL;
   * main query (see Section 7.1.11, <<sql_query>>) is executed and the
     rows it returns are indexed;
   * post-query (see Section 7.1.17, <<sql_query_post>>) is executed to
     perform any necessary cleanup;
   * connection to the database is closed;
   * indexer does the sorting phase (to be pedantic, index-type specific
     post-processing);
   * connection to the database is established again;
   * post-index query (see Section 7.1.18, <<sql_query_post_index>>) is
     executed to perform any necessary final cleanup;
   * connection to the database is closed again.

Most options, such as database user/host/password, are straightforward.
However, there are a few subtle things, which are discussed in more detail
here.

Ranged queries
--------------

Main query, which needs to fetch all the documents, can impose a read lock
on the whole table and stall the concurrent queries (eg. INSERTs to MyISAM
table), waste a lot of memory for result set, etc. To avoid this, Sphinx
supports so-called ranged queries. With ranged queries, Sphinx first
fetches min and max document IDs from the table, and then substitutes
different ID intervals into main query text and runs the modified query to
fetch another chunk of documents. Here's an example.

Example 1. Ranged query usage example

   | # in sphinx.conf
   | 
   | sql_query_range	= SELECT MIN(id),MAX(id) FROM documents
   | sql_range_step = 1000
   | sql_query = SELECT * FROM documents WHERE id>=$start AND id<=$end

If the table contains document IDs from 1 to, say, 2345, then sql_query
would be run three times:

   1. with $start replaced with 1 and $end replaced with 1000;
   2. with $start replaced with 1001 and $end replaced with 2000;
   3. with $start replaced with 2000 and $end replaced with 2345.

Obviously, that's not much of a difference for 2000-row table, but when it
comes to indexing 10-million-row MyISAM table, ranged queries might be of
some help.

sql_post vs. sql_post_index
---------------------------

The difference between post-query and post-index query is in that
post-query is run immediately when Sphinx received all the documents, but
further indexing may still fail for some other reason. On the contrary, by
the time the post-index query gets executed, it is guaranteed that the
indexing was succesful. Database connection is dropped and re-established
because sorting phase can be very lengthy and would just timeout otherwise.

3.7. XMLpipe data source
------------------------

XMLpipe data source is designed to enable users to plug data into Sphinx
without having to implement new data sources drivers themselves.

To use XMLpipe, configure the data source in your configuration file as
follows:

   | source example_xmlpipe_source
   | {
   |     type = xmlpipe
   |     xmlpipe_command = perl /www/mysite.com/bin/sphinxpipe.pl
   | }

The indexer will run the command specified in xmlpipe_command, and then
read, parse and index the data it prints to stdout.

XMLpipe driver expects the data to be in special XML format. Here's the
example document stream, consisting of two documents:

Example 2. XMLpipe document stream

   | <document>
   | <id>123</id>
   | <group>45</group>
   | <timestamp>1132223498</timestamp>
   | <title>test title</title>
   | <body>
   | this is my document body
   | </body>
   | </document>
   | 
   | <document>
   | <id>124</id>
   | <group>46</group>
   | <timestamp>1132223498</timestamp>
   | <title>another test</title>
   | <body>
   | this is another document
   | </body>
   | </document>

At the moment, the driver is using a custom manually written parser which
is pretty fast but really strict; so almost all the fields must be present,
formatted exactly as in this example, and occur exactly in this order. The
only optional field is timestamp; it's set to 1 if it's missing.

3.8. Live index updates
-----------------------

There's a frequent situation when the total dataset is too big to be
reindexed from scratch often, but the amount of new records is rather
small. Example: a forum with a 1,000,000 archived posts, but only 1,000 new
posts per day.

In this case, "live" (almost real time) index updates could be implemented
using so called "main+delta" scheme.

The idea is to set up two sources and two indexes, with one "main" index
for the data which only changes rarely (if ever), and one "delta" for the
new documents. In the example above, 1,000,000 archived posts would go to
the main index, and newly inserted 1,000 posts/day would go to the delta
index. Delta index could then be reindexed very frequently, and the
documents can be made available to search in a matter of minutes.

Specifying which documents should go to what index and reindexing main
index could also be made fully automatical. One option would be to make
a counter table which would track the ID which would split the documents,
and update it whenever the main index is reindexed.

Example 3. Fully automated live updates

   | # in MySQL
   | CREATE TABLE sph_counter
   | (
   |     counter_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL,
   |     max_doc_id INTEGER NOT NULL
   | );
   | 
   | # in sphinx.conf
   | source main
   | {
   |     # ...
   |     sql_query_pre = REPLACE INTO sph_counter SELECT 1, MAX(id) FROM documents
   |     sql_query = SELECT id, title, body FROM documents \
   |         WHERE id<=( SELECT max_doc_id FROM sph_counter WHERE counter_id=1 )
   | }
   | 
   | source delta : main
   | {
   |     sql_query_pre =
   |     sql_query = SELECT id, title, body FROM documents \
   |         WHERE id>( SELECT max_doc_id FROM sph_counter WHERE counter_id=1 )
   | }
   | 
   | index main
   | {
   |     source = main
   |     path = /path/to/main
   |     # ... all the other settings
   | }
   | 
   | # note how all other settings are copied from main,
   | # but source and path are overridden (they MUST be)
   | index delta : main
   | {
   |     source = delta
   |     path = /path/to/delta
   | }

4. Searching
============

4.1. Matching modes
-------------------

There are the following matching modes available:

   * SPH_MATCH_ALL, matches all query words (default mode);
   * SPH_MATCH_ANY, matches any of the query words;
   * SPH_MATCH_PHRASE, matches query as a phrase, requiring perfect match;
   * SPH_MATCH_BOOLEAN, matches query as a boolean expression (see
     Section 4.2, <<Boolean query syntax>>);
   * SPH_MATCH_EXTENDED, matches query as an expression in Sphinx internal
     query language (see Section 4.3, <<Extended query syntax>>).

4.2. Boolean query syntax
-------------------------

Boolean queries allow the following special operators to be used:

   * explicit operator AND:

      | hello & world

   * operator OR:

      | hello | world

   * operator NOT:

      | hello -world
      | hello !world

   * grouping:

      | ( hello world )

Here's an example query which uses all these operators:

Example 4. Boolean query example

   | ( cat -dog ) | ( cat -mouse)

There always is implicit AND operator, so "hello world" query actually
means "hello & world".

OR operator precedence is higher than AND, so "looking for cat | dog |
mouse" means "looking for ( cat | dog | mouse )" and not "(looking for cat)
| dog | mouse".

Queries like "-dog", which implicitly include all documents from the
collection, can not be evaluated. This is both for technical and
performance reasons. Technically, Sphinx does not always keep a list of all
IDs. Performance-wise, when the collection is huge (ie. 10-100M documents),
evaluating such queries could take very long.

4.3. Extended query syntax
--------------------------

Extended queries allow the following special operators to be used:

   * operator OR:

      | hello | world

   * operator NOT:

      | hello -world
      | hello !world

   * field search operator:

      | @title hello @body world

   * phrase search operator:

      | "hello world"

   * proximity search operator:

      | "hello world"~10

Here's an example query which uses all these operators:

Example 5. Extended query example

   | "hello world" @title "example program"~5 @body python -(php|perl)

There always is implicit AND operator, so "hello world" means that both
"hello" and "world" must be present in matching document.

OR operator precedence is higher than AND, so "looking for cat | dog |
mouse" means "looking for ( cat | dog | mouse )" and not "(looking for cat)
| dog | mouse".

Proximity distance is specified in words, adjusted for word count, and
applies to all words within quotes. For instance, "cat dog mouse"~5 query
means that there must be less than 8-word span which contains all 3 words,
ie. "CAT aaa bbb ccc DOG eee fff MOUSE" document will not match this query,
because this span is exactly 8 words long.

Nested brackets, as in queries like

   | aaa | ( bbb ccc | ( ddd eee ) )

are not allowed yet, but this will be fixed.

Negation (ie. operator NOT) is only allowed on top level and not within
brackets (ie. groups). This isn't going to change, because supporting
nested negations would make phrase ranking implementation way too
complicated.

4.4. Weighting
--------------

Specific weighting function (currently) depends on the search mode.

There are these major parts which are used in the weighting functions:

   1. phrase rank,
   2. statistical rank.

Phrase rank is based on a length of longest common subsequence (LCS) of
search words between document body and query phrase. So if there's
a perfect phrase match in some document then its phrase rank would be the
highest possible, and equal to query words count.

Statistical rank is based on classic BM25 function which only takes word
frequencies into account. If the word is rare in the whole database (ie.
low frequency over document collection) or mentioned a lot in specific
document (ie. high frequency over matching document), it receives more
weight. Final BM25 weight is a floating point number between 0 and 1.

In all modes, per-field weighted phrase ranks are computed as a product of
LCS multiplied by per-field weight speficifed by user. Per-field weights
are integer, default to 1, and can not be set lower than 1.

In SPH_MATCH_BOOLEAN mode, no weighting is performed at all, every match
weight is set to 1.

In SPH_MATCH_ALL and SPH_MATCH_PHRASE modes, final weight is a sum of
weighted phrase ranks.

In SPH_MATCH_ANY mode, the idea is essentially the same, but it also adds
a count of matching words in each field. Before that, weighted phrase ranks
are additionally mutliplied by a value big enough to guarantee that higher
phrase rank in any field will make the match ranked higher, even if it's
field weight is low.

In SPH_MATCH_EXTENDED mode, final weight is a sum of weighted phrase ranks
and BM25 weight, multiplied by 1000 and rounded to integer.

This is going to be changed, so that MATCH_ALL and MATCH_ANY modes use BM25
weights as well. This would improve search results in those match spans
where phrase ranks are equal; this is especially useful for 1-word queries.

The key idea (in all modes, besides boolean) is that better subphrase
matches are ranked higher, and perfect matches are pulled to the top.
Author's experience is that this phrase proximity based ranking provides
noticeably better search quality than any statistical scheme alone (such as
BM25, which is commonly used in other search engines).

4.5. Sorting modes
------------------

There are the following result sorting modes available:

   * SPH_SORT_RELEVANCE, sorts by relevance in descending order (best
     matches first);
   * SPH_SORT_ATTR_DESC, sorts by attribute in descending order (bigger
     attribute values first);
   * SPH_SORT_ATTR_ASC, sorts by attribute in ascending order (smaller
     attribute values first);
   * SPH_SORT_TIME_SEGMENTS, sorts by time segments (last
     hour/day/week/month) in descending order, and then by relevance in
     descending order;
   * SPH_SORT_EXTENDED, sorts by SQL-like expression.

SPH_SORT_ATTR_ASC, SPH_SORT_ATTR_DESC and SPH_SORT_TIME_SEGMENTS modes
require an attribute to sort by to be specified.

SPH_SORT_TIME_SEGMENTS mode
---------------------------

In SPH_SORT_TIME_SEGMENTS mode, attribute values are split into so-called
time segments, and then sorted by time segment first, and by relevance
second.

The segments are calculated according to the current timestamp at the time
when the search is performed, so the results would change over time. The
segments are as follows:

   * last hour,
   * last day,
   * last week,
   * last month,
   * last 3 months,
   * everything else.

These segments are hardcoded, but it is trivial to change them if
necessary.

This mode was added to support searching through blogs, news headlines,
etc. When using time segments, recent records would be ranked higher
because of segment, but withing the same segment, more relevant records
would be ranked higher - unlike sorting by just the timestamp attribute,
which would not take relevance into account at all.

SPH_SORT_EXTENDED mode
----------------------

In SPH_SORT_EXTENDED mode, you would specify an SQL-like sort expression to
sort by:

   | @relevance DESC, price ASC, @id DESC

Both internal attributes (their names start with @) and externally
specified user attributes (their names are as is) can be allowed. In the
example above, @relevance and @id are internal attributes and price is
user-speficied.

Known internal attributes are:

   * @id (match ID)
   * @rank (match weight)
   * @weight (match weight)
   * @relevance (match weight)

@rank, @weight and @relevance are just aliases; there's no actual
difference between them.

4.6. Grouping (clustering) search results
-----------------------------------------

Sometimes it could be useful to group (or in other terms, cluster) search
results and/or count per-group match counts - for instance, to draw a nice
graph of how much maching blog posts were there per each month; or to group
Web search results by site; or to group matching forum posts by author;
etc.

In theory, this could be performed by doing only the full-text search in
Sphinx and then using found IDs to group on SQL server side. However, in
practice doing this with a big result set (10K-10M matches) would typically
kill performance.

To avoid that, Sphinx offers so-called grouping mode. It is enabled with
SetGroupBy() API call. When grouping, all matches are assigned to different
groups based on group-by value. This value is computed from specified
attribute using one of the following built-in functions:

   * SPH_GROUPBY_DAY, extracts year, month and day in YYYYMMDD format from
     timestamp;
   * SPH_GROUPBY_WEEK, extracts year and first day of the week number
     (counting from year start) in YYYYNNN format from timestamp;
   * SPH_GROUPBY_MONTH, extracts month in YYYYMM format from timestamp;
   * SPH_GROUPBY_YEAR, extracts year in YYYY format from timestamp;
   * SPH_GROUPBY_ATTR, uses attribute value itself for grouping.

The final search result set then contains one best match per group.
Grouping function value and per-group match count are returned along as
"virtual" attributes named @group and @count respectively.

The result set is sorted by group-by sorting clause, with the syntax
similar to SPH_SORT_EXTENDED sorting clause syntax. In addition to @id and
@weight, group-by sorting clause may also include:

   * @group (groupby function value),
   * @count (amount of matches in group).

The default mode is to sort by groupby value in descending order, ie. by
"@group desc".

On completion, total_found result parameter would contain total amount of
matching groups over he whole index.

WARNING: grouping is done in fixed memory and thus its results are only
approximate; so there might be more groups reported in total_found than
actually present. @count might also be underestimated. To reduce
inaccuracy, one should raise max_matches. If max_matches allows to store
all found groups, results will be 100% correct.

For example, if sorting by relevance and grouping by "published" attribute
with SPH_GROUPBY_DAY function, then the result set will contain

   * one most relevant match per each day when there were any matches
     published,
   * with day number and per-day match count attached,
   * sorted by day number in descending order (ie. recent days first).

4.7. Distributed searching
--------------------------

To scale well, Sphinx has distributed searching capabilities. Distributed
searching is useful to improve query latency (ie. search time) and
throughput (ie. max queries/sec) in multi-server, multi-CPU or multi-core
environments. This is essential for applications which need to search
through huge amounts data (ie. billions of records and terabytes of text).

The key idea is to horizontally partition (HP) searched data accross search
nodes and then process it in parallel.

Partitioning is done manually. You would

   * setup several instances of Sphinx programs (indexer and searchd) on
     different servers;
   * make the instances index (and search) different parts of data;
   * configure a special distributed index on some of the searchd
     instances;
   * and query this index.

This index only contains references to other local and remote indexes - so
it could not be directly reindexed, and you should reindex those indexes
which it references instead.

When searchd receives a query against distributed index, it does the
following:

   1. connects to configured remote agents;
   2. issues the query;
   3. sequentially searches configured local indexes (while the remote
      agents are searching);
   4. retrieves remote agents' search results;
   5. merges all the results together, removing the duplicates;
   6. sends the merged resuls to client.

From the application's point of view, there are no differences between
usual and distributed index at all.

Any searchd instance could serve both as a master (which aggregates the
results) and a slave (which only does local searching) at the same time.
This has a number of uses:

   1. every machine in a cluster could serve as a master which searches the
      whole cluster, and search requests could be balanced between masters
      to achieve a kind of HA (high availability) in case any of the nodes
      fails;
   2. if running within a single multi-CPU or multi-core machine, there
      would be only 1 searchd instance quering itself as an agent and thus
      utilizing all CPUs/core.

It is scheduled to implement better HA support which would allow to specify
which agents mirror each other, do health checks, keep track of alive
agents, load-balance requests, etc.

4.8. searchd query log format
-----------------------------

searchd logs all succesfully executed search queries into query log file.
Here's an example:

   | [Fri Jun 29 21:17:58 2007] 0.004 sec [all/0/rel 35254 (0,20)] [lj] test
   | [Fri Jun 29 21:20:34 2007] 0.024 sec [all/0/rel 19886 (0,20) @channel_id] [lj] test

This log format is as follows:

   | [query-date] query-time [match-mode/filters-count/sort-mode
   |     total-matches (offset,limit) @groupby-attr] [index-name] query

Match mode can take one of the following values:

   * "all" for SPH_MATCH_ALL mode;
   * "any" for SPH_MATCH_ANY mode;
   * "phr" for SPH_MATCH_PHRASE mode;
   * "bool" for SPH_MATCH_BOOLEAN mode;
   * "ext" for SPH_MATCH_EXTENDED mode.

Sort mode can take one of the following values:

   * "rel" for SPH_SORT_RELEVANCE mode;
   * "attr-" for SPH_SORT_ATTR_DESC mode;
   * "attr+" for SPH_SORT_ATTR_ASC mode;
   * "tsegs" for SPH_SORT_TIME_SEGMENTS mode;
   * "ext" for SPH_SORT_EXTENDED mode.

5. MySQL storage engine (SphinxSE)
==================================

5.1. SphinxSE overview
----------------------

SphinxSE is MySQL storage engine which can be compiled into MySQL server
5.x using its pluggable architecure. It is not available for MySQL 4.x
series. It also requires MySQL 5.0.22 or higher in 5.0.x series, or MySQL
5.1.12 or higher in 5.1.x series.

Despite the name, SphinxSE does not actually store any data itself. It is
actually a built-in client which allows MySQL server to talk to searchd,
run search queries, and obtain search results. All indexing and searching
happen outside MySQL.

Obvious SphinxSE applications include:

   * easier porting of MySQL FTS applications to Sphinx;
   * allowing Sphinx use with progamming languages for which native APIs
     are not available yet;
   * optimizations when additional Sphinx result set processing on MySQL
     side is required (eg. JOINs with original document tables, additional
     MySQL-side filtering, etc).

5.2. Installing SphinxSE
------------------------

You will need to obtain a copy of MySQL sources, prepare those, and then
recompile MySQL binary. MySQL sources (mysql-5.x.yy.tar.gz) could be
obtained from dev.mysql.com Web site.

For some MySQL versions, there are delta tarballs with already prepared
source versions available from Sphinx Web site. After unzipping those over
original sources MySQL would be ready to be configured and built with
Sphinx support.

If such tarball is not available, or does not work for you for any reason,
you would have to prepare sources manually. You will need to GNU Autotools
framework (autoconf, automake and libtool) installed to do that.

5.2.1. Compiling MySQL 5.0.x with SphinxSE
------------------------------------------

Skips steps 1-3 if using already prepared delta tarball.

   1. copy sphinx.5.0.yy.diff patch file into MySQL sources directory and
      run

      | patch -p1 < sphinx.5.0.yy.diff

      If there's no .diff file exactly for the specific version you need to
      build, try applying .diff with closest version numbers. It is
      important that the patch should apply with no rejects.

   2. in MySQL sources directory, run

      | sh BUILD/autorun.sh

   3. in MySQL sources directory, create sql/sphinx directory in and copy
      all files in mysqlse directory from Sphinx sources there. Example:

      | cp -R /root/builds/sphinx-0.9.7/mysqlse /root/builds/mysql-5.0.24/sql/sphinx

   4. configure MySQL and enable Sphinx engine:

      | ./configure --with-sphinx-storage-engine

   5. build and install MySQL:

      | make
      | make install

5.2.2. Compiling MySQL 5.1.x with SphinxSE
------------------------------------------

Skip steps 1-2 if using already prepared delta tarball.

   1. in MySQL sources directory, create storage/sphinx directory in and
      copy all files in mysqlse directory from Sphinx sources there.
      Example:

      | cp -R /root/builds/sphinx-0.9.7/mysqlse /root/builds/mysql-5.1.14/storage/sphinx

   2. in MySQL sources directory, run

      | sh BUILD/autorun.sh

   3. configure MySQL and enable Sphinx engine:

      | ./configure --with-plugins=sphinx

   4. build and install MySQL:

      | make
      | make install

5.2.3. Checking SphinxSE installation
-------------------------------------

To check whether SphinxSE has been succesfully compiled into MySQL, launch
newly built servers, run mysql client and issue SHOW ENGINES query. You
should see a list of all available engines. Sphinx should be present and
"Support" column should contain "YES":

   |      
   | mysql> show engines;
   | +------------+----------+----------------------------------------------------------------+
   | | Engine     | Support  | Comment                                                        |
   | +------------+----------+----------------------------------------------------------------+
   | | MyISAM     | DEFAULT  | Default engine as of MySQL 3.23 with great performance         |
   |   ...
   | | SPHINX     | YES      | Sphinx storage engine                                          |
   |   ...
   | +------------+----------+----------------------------------------------------------------+
   | 13 rows in set (0.00 sec)    

5.3. Using SphinxSE
-------------------

To search via SphinxSE, you would need to create special ENGINE=SPHINX
"search table", and then SELECT from it with full text query put into WHERE
clause for query column.

Let's begin with an example create statement and search query:

   | CREATE TABLE t1
   | (
   |     id          INTEGER NOT NULL,
   |     weight      INTEGER NOT NULL,
   |     query       VARCHAR(3072) NOT NULL,
   |     group_id    INTEGER,
   |     INDEX(query)
   | ) ENGINE=SPHINX CONNECTION="sphinx://localhost:3312/test";
   | 
   | SELECT * FROM t1 WHERE query='test it;mode=any';

First 3 columns of search table must be INTEGER, INTEGER and VARCHAR which
will be mapped to document ID, match weight and search query accordingly.
There also must be indexes on document ID and search query columns. These
columns' names are insignficant.

Additional columns must be either INTEGER or TIMESTAMP. They will be bound
to attributes provided in Sphinx result set by name, so their names must
match attribute names specified in sphinx.conf. If there's no such
attribute name in Sphinx search results, column will have NULL values.

Special "virtual" attributes names can also be bound to SphinxSE columns.
_sph_ needs to be used instead of @ for that. For instance, to obtain
@group and @count virtual attributes, use _sph_group and _sph_count column
names.

CONNECTION string parameter can be used to specify default searchd host,
port and indexes for queries issued using this table. If no connection
string is specified in CREATE TABLE, index name "*" (ie. search all
indexes) and localhost:3312 are assumed. Connection string syntax is as
follows:

   | CONNECTION="sphinx://HOST:PORT/INDEXNAME"

You can change the default connection string later:

   | ALTER TABLE t1 CONNECTION="sphinx://NEWHOST:NEWPORT/NEWINDEXNAME";

You can also override all these parameters per-query.

As seen in example, both query text and search options should be put into
WHERE clause on search query column (ie. 3rd column); the options are
separated by semicolons; and their names from values by equality sign. Any
number of options can be specified. Available options are:

   * query - query text;
   * mode - matching mode. Must be one of "all", "any", "phrase",
     "boolean", or "extended". Default is "all";
   * sort - match sorting mode. Must be one of "relevance", "attr_desc",
     "attr_asc", "time_segments", or "extended". In all modes besides
     "relevance" attribute name (or sorting clause for "extended") is also
     required after a colon:

      | ... WHERE query='test;sort=attr_asc:group_id';
      | ... WHERE query='test;sort=extended:@weight desc, group_id asc';

   * offset - offset into result set, default is 0;
   * limit - amount of matches to retrieve from result set, default is 20;
   * index - names of the indexes to search:

      | ... WHERE query='test;index=test1;';
      | ... WHERE query='test;index=test1,test2,test3;';

   * minid, maxid - min and max document ID to match;
   * weights - comma-separated list of weights to be assigned to Sphinx
     full-text fields:

      | ... WHERE query='test;weights=1,2,3;';

   * filter, !filter - comma-separated attribute name and a set of values
     to match:

      | # only include groups 1, 5 and 19
      | ... WHERE query='test;filter=group_id,1,5,19;';
      | 
      | # exclude groups 3 and 11
      | ... WHERE query='test;!filter=group_id,3,11;';

   * range, !range - comma-separated attribute name, min and max value to
     match:

      | # include groups from 3 to 7, inclusive
      | ... WHERE query='test;range=group_id,3,7;';
      | 
      | # exclude groups from 5 to 25
      | ... WHERE query='test;!range=group_id,5,25;';

   * maxmatches - per-query max matches value:

      | ... WHERE query='test;maxmatches=2000;';

   * groupby - group-by function and attribute:

      | ... WHERE query='test;groupby=day:published_ts;';
      | ... WHERE query='test;groupby=attr:group_id;';

   * groupsort - group-by sorting clause:

      | ... WHERE query='test;groupsort=@count desc;';

One very important note that it is much more efficient to allow Sphinx to
perform sorting, filtering and slicing the result set than to raise max
matches count and use WHERE, ORDER BY and LIMIT clauses on MySQL side. This
is for two reasons. First, Sphinx does a number of optimizations and
performs better than MySQL on these tasks. Second, less data would need to
be packed by searchd, transferred and unpacked by SphinxSE.

Additional query info besides result set could be retrieved with SHOW
ENGINE SPHINX STATUS statement:

   | mysql> SHOW ENGINE SPHINX STATUS;
   | +--------+-------+-------------------------------------------------+
   | | Type   | Name  | Status                                          |
   | +--------+-------+-------------------------------------------------+
   | | SPHINX | stats | total: 25, total found: 25, time: 126, words: 2 | 
   | | SPHINX | words | sphinx:591:1256 soft:11076:15945                | 
   | +--------+-------+-------------------------------------------------+
   | 2 rows in set (0.00 sec)

You could perform JOINs on SphinxSE search table and tables using other
engines. Here's an example with "documents" from example.sql:

   | mysql> SELECT content, date_added FROM test.documents docs
   | -> JOIN t1 ON (docs.id=t1.id) 
   | -> WHERE query="one document;mode=any";
   | +-------------------------------------+---------------------+
   | | content                             | docdate             |
   | +-------------------------------------+---------------------+
   | | this is my test document number two | 2006-06-17 14:04:28 | 
   | | this is my test document number one | 2006-06-17 14:04:28 | 
   | +-------------------------------------+---------------------+
   | 2 rows in set (0.00 sec)
   | 
   | mysql> SHOW ENGINE SPHINX STATUS;
   | +--------+-------+---------------------------------------------+
   | | Type   | Name  | Status                                      |
   | +--------+-------+---------------------------------------------+
   | | SPHINX | stats | total: 2, total found: 2, time: 0, words: 2 | 
   | | SPHINX | words | one:1:2 document:2:2                        | 
   | +--------+-------+---------------------------------------------+
   | 2 rows in set (0.00 sec)

6. Reporting bugs
=================

Unfortunately, Sphinx is not yet 100% bug free (even though I'm working
hard towards that), so you might occasionally run into some issues.

Reporting as much as possible about each bug is very important - because to
fix it, I need to be able either to reproduce and debug the bug, or to
deduce what's causing it from the information that you provide. So here are
some instructions on how to do that.

Build-time issues
-----------------

If Sphinx fails to build for some reason, please do the following:

   1. check that headers and libraries for your DBMS are properly installed
      (for instance, check that mysql-devel package is present);
   2. report Sphinx version and config file (be sure to remove the
      passwords!), MySQL (or PostgreSQL) configuration info, gcc version,
      OS version and CPU type (ie. x86, x86-64, PowerPC, etc):

      | mysql_config
      | gcc --version
      | uname -a

   3. report the error message which is produced by configure or gcc (it
      should be to include error message itself only, not the whole build
      log).

Run-time issues
---------------

If Sphinx builds and runs, but there are any problems running it, please do
the following:

   1. describe the bug (ie. both the expected behavior and actual behavior)
      and all the steps necessary to reproduce it;
   2. include Sphinx version and config file (be sure to remove the
      passwords!), MySQL (or PostgreSQL) version, gcc version, OS version
      and CPU type (ie. x86, x86-64, PowerPC, etc):

      | mysql --version
      | gcc --version
      | uname -a

   3. build, install and run debug versions of all Sphinx programs (this is
      to enable a lot of additional internal checks, so-called assertions):

      | make distclean
      | ./configure --with-debug
      | make install
      | killall -TERM searchd

   4. reindex to check if any assertions are triggered (in this case, it's
      likely that the index is corrupted and causing problems);
   5. if the bug does not reproduce with debug versions, revert to
      non-debug and mention it in your report;
   6. if the bug could be easily reproduced with a small (1-100 record)
      part of your database, please provide a gzipped dump of that part;
   7. if the problem is related to searchd, include relevant entries from
      searchd.log and query.log in your bug report;
   8. if the problem is related to searchd, try running it in console mode
      and check if it dies with an assertion:

      | ./searchd --console

   9. if any program dies with an assertion, provide the assertion message.

Debugging assertions, crashes and hangups
-----------------------------------------

If any program dies with an assertion, crashes without an assertion or
hangs up, you would additionally need to generate a core dump and examine
it.

   1. enable core dumps. On most Linux systems, this is done using ulimit:

      | ulimit -c 32768

   2. run the program and try to reproduce the bug;
   3. if the program crashes (either with or without an assertion), find
      the core file in current directory (it should typically print out
      "Segmentation fault (core dumped)" message);
   4. if the program hangs, use kill -SEGV from another console to force it
      to exit and dump core:

      | kill -SEGV HANGED-PROCESS-ID

   5. use gdb to examine the core file and obtain a backtrace:

      | gdb ./CRASHED-PROGRAM-FILE-NAME CORE-DUMP-FILE-NAME
      | (gdb) bt
      | (gdb) quit

Note that HANGED-PROCESS-ID, CRASHED-PROGRAM-FILE-NAME and
CORE-DUMP-FILE-NAME must all be replaced with specific numbers and file
names. For example, hanged searchd debugging session would look like:

   | # kill -SEGV 12345
   | # ls *core*
   | core.12345
   | # gdb ./searchd core.12345
   | (gdb) bt
   | ...
   | (gdb) quit

Note that ulimit is not server-wide and only affects current shell session.
This means that you will not have to restore any server-wide limits - but
if you relogin, you will have to set ulimit again.

Core dumps should be placed in current working directory (and Sphinx
programs do not change it), so this is where you would look for them.

Please do not immediately remove the core file because there could be
additional helpful information which could be retrieved from it. You do not
need to send me this file (as the debug info there is closely tied to your
system) but I might need to ask you a few additional questions about it.

7. sphinx.conf options reference
================================

7.1. Data source configuration options
--------------------------------------

7.1.1. type
-----------

Data source type. Available types are mysql, pgsql and xmlpipe.

This option is mandatory.

Example:

   | type = mysql

7.1.2. strip_html
-----------------

Whether to strip HTML formatting from incoming full-text data. 0 means that
stripping should be disabled; 1 that it should be enabled.

Stripping currently works with mysql and pgsql source, and is not yet
implemented for xmlpipe. It should work with properly formed HTML (such as
well-formed XHTML) but MAY bug on malformed HTML (such as with stray <'s or
unclosed >'s).

This option is optional. Default value is 0 (do not strip HTML). This
option only applies to mysql and pgsql source types.

Example:

   | strip_html = 0

7.1.3. index_html_attrs
-----------------------

Specifies which HTML attributes' contents still should be indexed when
stripping HTML. The format is per-tag enumeration of indexable attributes,
as shown in the example below.

This option is optional. Default value is empty (do not index anything).
This option only applies to mysql and pgsql source types.

Example:

   | index_html_attrs = img=alt,title; a=title;

source types.

Example:

   | sql_pass = mysecretpassword

7.1.8. sql_db
-------------

SQL database (in MySQL terms) to use after connection and perform further
queries in.

This option is mandatory. This option only applies to mysql and pgsql
source types.

Example:

   | sql_db = test

7.1.9. sql_sock
---------------

UNIX socket name to connect to local MySQL server.

On Linux, it would typically be /var/lib/mysql/mysql.sock. On FreeBSD, it
would typically be /tmp/mysql.sock.

This option is optional. This option only applies to mysql source type.

Example:

   | sql_sock = /tmp/mysql.sock

7.1.10. sql_query_pre
---------------------

Pre-fetch query, or pre-query.

There might be multiple pre-queries specified. They are executed before the
main fetch query in exactly the same order they were specified in config
file. Pre-query results are ignored.

Pre-queries are useful to setup encoding, or mark records which are going
to be indexed, or update internal counters, etc.

This option is optional. This option only applies to mysql and pgsql source
types.

Example:

   | sql_query_pre = SET CHARACTER_SET_RESULTS=utf-8

7.1.11. sql_query
-----------------

Main document fetch query.

There can be only one main query. This is the query which is used to
retrieve documents from SQL server.

You can specify up to 32 fields (formally, upto SPH_MAX_FIELDS from
sphinx.h). All of the fields which are not document ID or attributes will
be full-text indexed.

Document ID MUST be the very first field, and it MUST BE UNIQUE UNSIGNED
NON-ZERO 32-BIT INTEGER NUMBER.

This option is mandatory. This option only applies to mysql and pgsql
source types.

Example:

   | sql_query = \
   | 	SELECT id, group_id, UNIX_TIMESTAMP(date_added) AS date_added, \
   | 		title, content \
   | 	FROM documents

7.1.12. sql_query_range
-----------------------

Query which fetches min/max document IDs range to be used in ranged query
(see Section 3.6, <<Ranged queries>>).

This option is optional. This option only applies to mysql and pgsql source
types.

Example:

   | sql_query_range = SELECT MIN(id),MAX(id) FROM documents

7.1.13. sql_range_step
----------------------

How much records to index per one ranged query step (see Section 3.6,
<<Ranged queries>>).

This option is optional. Default value is 1024. This option only applies to
mysql and pgsql source types.

Example:

   | sql_range_step = 1000

7.1.14. sql_group_column
------------------------

Integer attribute column declaration. Specified column should be present
among those fetched by Section 7.1.11, <<sql_query>>.

There might be multiple attributes specified.

This option is optional. This option only applies to mysql and pgsql source
types.

Example:

   | sql_group_column = group_id    # declare 1st attribute
   | sql_group_column = author_id   # declare 2nd attribute

7.1.15. sql_date_column
-----------------------

UNIX timestamp attribute column declaration. Specified column should be
present among those fetched by Section 7.1.11, <<sql_query>>.

There might be multiple attributes specified.

This option is optional. This option only applies to mysql and pgsql source
types.

Example:

   | sql_date_column = added_ts

7.1.16. sql_str2ordinal_column
------------------------------

Ordinal string number attribute column declaration. Specified column should
be present among those fetched by Section 7.1.11, <<sql_query>>.

When indexing such attributes, string values are fetched from database,
stored, sorted and then replaced by ordinal number (integer) in the sorted
strings array. These integers could then be used when searching to sort by
by string values lexicographically.

WARNING, all such string values are going to be stored in RAM while
indexing!

WARNING, "C" locale will be used when sorting!

There might be multiple attributes specified.

This option is optional. This option only applies to mysql and pgsql source
types.

Example:

   | sql_str2ordinal_column = author_name

7.1.17. sql_query_post
----------------------

Post-fetch query, executed immediately after main fetch query
(Section 7.1.11, <<sql_query>>) ends. If this query produces errors, they
are reported as warnings, but indexing is NOT terminated. It's result set
is ignored.

Note that indexing is NOT completed at the point when post-query gets
executed, and further indexing might fail.

This option is optional. This option only applies to mysql and pgsql source
types.

Example:

   | sql_query_post = DROP TABLE my_tmp_table

7.1.18. sql_query_post_index
----------------------------

Post-index query, executed when indexing is succesfully completed. If this
query produces errors, they are reported as warnings, but indexing is NOT
terminated. It's result set is ignored.

In this query, you can use $maxid macro, expanded to max document ID which
was actually fetched from the database during indexing.

This option is optional. This option only applies to mysql and pgsql source
types.

Example:

   | sql_query_post_index = REPLACE INTO counters ( id, val ) \
   |     VALUES ( 'max_indexed_id', $maxid )

7.1.19. sql_query_info
----------------------

Document info query. Only used by CLI search to fetch and display document
information; and only intended for debugging purposes.

This query fetches info to be displayed by CLI search utility by document
ID. Therefore, it must contain $id macro.

This option is optional. This option only applies to mysql and pgsql source
types.

Example:

   | sql_query_info = SELECT * FROM documents WHERE id=$id

7.1.20. xmlpipe_command
-----------------------

Command which will be executed in xmlpipe mode to obtain documents. See
Section 3.7, <<XMLpipe data source>> for output format description.

This option is mandatory. This option only applies to xmlpipe source type.

Example:

   | xmlpipe_command = cat /home/sphinx/test.xml

7.2. searchd program configuration options
------------------------------------------

7.2.1. seamless_rotate
----------------------

This feature prevents short periods of searchd being inaccessible while
rotating indexes with huge attribute and/or dictionary files (.spa and .spi
respectively).

Normally, rotating an index works as follows:

   1. new queries are temporarly rejected (with "retry" error code);
   2. searchd waits for all currently running queries to finish;
   3. old index is deallocated and its files are renamed;
   4. new index files are renamed and required RAM is allocated;
   5. new index attribute and dictionary data is preloaded to RAM;
   6. searchd resumes serving queries from new index.

However, if there's a lot of attribute or dictionary data, then preloading
step could take noticeble time - up to several minutes in case of
preloading 1-5+ GB files.

With seamless rotate enabled, rotating works as follows:

   1. new index RAM storage is allocated;
   2. new index attribute and dictionary data is asynchronously preloaded
      to RAM;
   3. on success, old index is deallocated and both indexes' files are
      renamed;
   4. on failure, new index is deallocated;
   5. at any given moment, queries are served either from old or new index
      copy.

Seamless rotate comes at the cost of higher peak memory usage during the
rotation (because both old and new copies of .spa and .spd data need to be
in RAM while preloading new copy). Average usage stays the same.

This option is optional. Default values is 1, which means to enable
seamless rotate.

Example:

   | seamless_rotate = 1
