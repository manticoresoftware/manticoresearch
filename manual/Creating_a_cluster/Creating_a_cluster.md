# Manticore cluster

Manticore Search is a highly distributed system and consists of all the needed components to allow you build a highly available and scalable setup of a database for search: 
* [distributed table](../Creating_a_table/Creating_a_distributed_table/Creating_a_distributed_table.md) allowing sharding
  * [Mirroring](../Creating_a_cluster/Remote_nodes/Mirroring.md) for high availability
  * [Load balancing](../Creating_a_cluster/Remote_nodes/Load_balancing.md) for high scalability
* [Replication](../Creating_a_cluster/Setting_up_replication/Setting_up_replication.md) for data safety

Manticore Search is extremely flexible in terms of how you setup your cluster, there's no limitations and it's up to you how you design it. Just learn the tools mentioned above and use them to achieve your goal.
