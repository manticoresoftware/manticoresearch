# Adding data from external storages

You can ingest data into Manticore from external storages using various methods:

* [Indexer tool](../Data_creation_and_modification/Adding_data_from_external_storages/Plain_tables_creation.md) to fetch data from various databases into plain tables.
* [Logstash](../Integration/Logstash.md), [Filebeat](../Integration/Filebeat.md), and [Vector.dev](https://manticoresearch.com/blog/integration-of-manticore-with-vectordev/) integrations to put data to Manticore real-time tables from these tools.
* [Kafka integration](../Integration/Kafka.md) to synchronize data from Kafka topics into a real-time table.
