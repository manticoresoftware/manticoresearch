# Installing Manticore packages on RedHat and CentOS

### Supported releases:

* CentOS 7, RHEL 7, Oracle Linux 7
* CentOS 8, RHEL 8, Oracle Linux 8, CentOS Stream 8
* Amazon Linux 2
* CentOS 9, RHEL 9, AlmaLinux 9

### YUM repository

The simplest method to install Manticore on RedHat/CentOS is by using our YUM repository:

Install the repository:
```bash
sudo yum install https://repo.manticoresearch.com/manticore-repo.noarch.rpm
```

Then install Manticore Search:
```bash
sudo yum install manticore manticore-extra
```

If you are upgrading to Manticore 6 from an older version, it is recommended to remove your old packages first to avoid conflicts caused by the updated package structure:

```bash
sudo yum remove manticore*
```

It won't remove your data and configuration file.

###### Development packages
If you prefer "Nightly" (development) versions do:

```bash
sudo yum -y install https://repo.manticoresearch.com/manticore-repo.noarch.rpm && \
sudo yum -y --enablerepo manticore-dev install manticore manticore-extra manticore-common manticore-server manticore-server-core manticore-tools manticore-executor manticore-buddy manticore-backup manticore-columnar-lib manticore-server-core-debuginfo manticore-tools-debuginfo manticore-columnar-lib-debuginfo  manticore-icudata manticore-galera manticore-galera-debuginfo manticore-language-packs
```

### Standalone RPM packages
To download standalone RPM files from the Manticore repository, follow the instructions available at https://manticoresearch.com/install/.

### More packages you may need
#### For indexer
If you plan to use [indexer](../Data_creation_and_modification/Adding_data_from_external_storages/Plain_tables_creation.md#Indexer-tool) to create tables from external sources, you'll need to make sure you have installed corresponding client libraries in order to make available of indexing sources you want. The line below will install all of them at once; feel free to use it as is, or to reduce it to install only libraries you need (for only mysql sources - just `mysql-libs` should be enough, and unixODBC is not necessary).

```bash
sudo yum install mysql-libs postgresql-libs expat unixODBC
```

In CentOS Stream 8 you may need to run:

```
dnf install mariadb-connector-c
```

if you get error `sql_connect: MySQL source wasn't initialized. Wrong name in dlopen?` trying to build a plain table from MySQL.

#### Ukrainian lemmatizer
The lemmatizer requires Python 3.9+. **Make sure you have it installed and that it's configured with `--enable-shared`.**

Here's how to install Python 3.9 and the Ukrainian lemmatizer in Centos 7/8:

```bash
# install Manticore Search and UK lemmatizer from YUM repository
yum -y install https://repo.manticoresearch.com/manticore-repo.noarch.rpm
yum -y install manticore manticore-lemmatizer-uk

# install packages needed for building Python
yum groupinstall "Development Tools" -y
yum install openssl-devel libffi-devel bzip2-devel wget -y

# download, build and install Python 3.9
cd ~
wget https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.9.2/Python-3.9.2.tgz
tar xvf Python-3.9.2.tgz
cd Python-3.9*/
./configure --enable-optimizations --enable-shared
make -j8 altinstall

# update linker cache
ldconfig

# install pymorphy2 and UK dictionary
pip3.9 install pymorphy2[fast]
pip3.9 install pymorphy2-dicts-uk
```
