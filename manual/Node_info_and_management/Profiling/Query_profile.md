# SHOW PROFILE

<!-- example SHOW PROFILE -->

`SHOW PROFILE` is an SQL statement that displays a detailed execution profile of the previous SQL statement executed in the current SQL session. Profiling must be enabled in the current session **before** running the statement to be instrumented, which can be done with a `SET profiling=1` statement. By default, profiling is disabled to avoid potential performance implications, and as a result, the profile will be empty.

* `Status` column briefly describes the specific state where the time was spent.
* `Duration` column shows the wall clock time, in seconds.
* `Switches` column displays the number of times the query engine changed to the given state. These are merely logical engine state switches and **not** any OS level context switches or function calls (although some sections might actually map to function calls), and they do **not** have any direct effect on performance. In a sense, the number of switches is just the number of times the respective instrumentation point was hit.
* `Percent` column shows the percentage of time spent in this state.

States in the profile are returned in a prerecorded order that roughly maps (but is **not** identical) to the actual query order.

The list of states may (and will) change over time as we refine the states. Here's a brief description of the currently profiled states.

* `unknown`: generic catch-all state. Accounts for not-yet-instrumented code or small miscellaneous tasks that don't really belong in any other state but are too small to warrant their own state.
* `net_read`: reading the query from the network (i.e., the application).
* `io`: generic file IO time.
* `dist_connect`: connecting to remote agents in the distributed table case.
* `sql_parse`: parsing the SQL syntax.
* `dict_setup`: dictionary and tokenizer setup.
* `parse`: parsing the full-text query syntax.
* `transforms`: full-text query transformations (wildcard and other expansions, simplification, etc.).
* `init`: initializing the query evaluation.
* `open`: opening the table files.
* `read_docs`: IO time spent reading document lists.
* `read_hits`: IO time spent reading keyword positions.
* `get_docs`: computing the matching documents.
* `get_hits`: computing the matching positions.
* `filter`: filtering the full-text matches.
* `rank`: computing the relevance rank.
* `sort`: sorting the matches.
* `finalize`: finalizing the per-table search result set (last stage expressions, etc.).
* `dist_wait`: waiting for remote results from agents in the distributed table case.
* `aggregate`: aggregating multiple result sets.
* `net_write`: writing the result set to the network.

## Query profiling in HTTP JSON

You can view the final transformed query tree with all normalized keywords by adding a `"profile":true` property:

```json
{
  "index":"test",
  "profile":true,
  "query":
  {
    "match_phrase": { "_all" : "had grown quite" }
  }
}
```

This feature is somewhat similar to the [SHOW PLAN](../../Node_info_and_management/Profiling/Query_plan.md) statement in SQL. The result appears as a profile property in the result set. For example:

```json
"profile":
{
  "query":
  {
    "type": "PHRASE",
    "description": "PHRASE( AND(KEYWORD(had, querypos=1)),  AND(KEYWORD(grown, querypos=2)),  AND(KEYWORD(quite, querypos=3)))",
    "children":
    [
      {
        "type": "AND",
        "description": "AND(KEYWORD(had, querypos=1))",
        "max_field_pos": 0,
        "children":
        [
          {
            "type": "KEYWORD",
            "word": "had",
            "querypos": 1
           }
        ]
      },
      {
        "type": "AND",
        "description": "AND(KEYWORD(grown, querypos=2))",
        "max_field_pos": 0,
        "children":
        [
          {
            "type": "KEYWORD",
            "word": "grown",
            "querypos": 2
          }
        ]
      },
      {
        "type": "AND",
        "description": "AND(KEYWORD(quite, querypos=3))",
        "max_field_pos": 0,
        "children":
        [
          {
            "type": "KEYWORD",
            "word": "quite",
            "querypos": 3
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

`query` property contains the transformed full-text query tree. Each node contains:

* `type`: node type. Can be AND, OR, PHRASE, KEYWORD, etc.
* `description`: query subtree for this node shown as a string (in `SHOW PLAN` format)
* `children`: child nodes, if any
* `max_field_pos`: maximum position within a field
* `word`: transformed keyword. Keyword nodes only
* `querypos`: position of this keyword in a query. Keyword nodes only
* `excluded`: keyword excluded from query. Keyword nodes only
* `expanded`: keyword added by prefix expansion. Keyword nodes only
* `field_start`: keyword must occur at the very start of the field. Keyword nodes only
* `field_end`: keyword must occur at the very end of the field. Keyword nodes only
* `boost`: keyword IDF will be multiplied by this. Keyword nodes only
