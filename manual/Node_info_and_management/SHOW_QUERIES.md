# SHOW QUERIES

<!-- example SHOW QUERIES -->
```sql
SHOW QUERIES
```

`SHOW QUERIES` returns information about all currently running queries. The output is a table with the following structure:

- `id`: Query ID that can be used in [KILL](../Node_info_and_management/KILL.md) to terminate the query
- `query`: Query statement or a portion of it
- `time`: Time taken on command execution or how long ago the query was performed (in this case, the value will include `ago`)
- `protocol`: [Connection protocol](../Server_settings/Searchd.md#listen), with possible values being `sphinx`, `mysql`, `http`, `ssl`, `compressed`, `replication`, or a combination (e.g., `http,ssl` or `compressed,mysql`)
- `host`: Client's `ip:port`
