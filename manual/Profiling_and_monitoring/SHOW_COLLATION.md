# SHOW COLLATION

```sql
SHOW COLLATION
```

This is currently a placeholder query that does nothing and reports success. That is in order to keep compatibility with frameworks and connectors that automatically execute this statement.

```sql
mysql> SHOW COLLATION;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)
```
