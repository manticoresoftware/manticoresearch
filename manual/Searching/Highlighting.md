# Highlighting

<!-- example highlighting -->

Highlighting allows you to get highlighted text fragments (called snippets) from documents that contain matching keywords.

SQL's `HIGHLIGHT()` function, `"highlight"` property in json queries via HTTP and `highlight()` function in the PHP client all use built-in document storage for retrieving original field contents (enabled by default).

When using SQL to highlight search results, you get different snippets from different fields concatenated as a single string. It is a limitation of mysql protocol. You can fine-tune concatenation separators with `field_separator` and `snippet_separator` options, see below.

When running json queries via HTTP or using the PHP client, there are no such limitations and the result set contains an array of fields which contains arrays of snippets (without the separators).

Note that snippet generation options such as `limit`, `limit_words`, `limit_snippets` are applied to each field separately (by default). You can change this behavior using the `limits_per_field` option, but it may lead to undesirable results. I.e. one of the fields has matching keywords, but no snippets from this field are included in the result set because they didn't rank as high as the snippets from the other fields in the highlighting engine.

Highlighting algorithm currently favors better snippets (with closer phrase matches), and then snippets with keywords not yet included in the result. Generally, it will try to highlight the best match with the query, and it will also try to highlight all the query keywords, as made possible by the limits. If there are no matches in the current field, the beginning of the document trimmed down according to the limits will be return by default. You can also return an empty string instead by setting `allow_empty` option to 1.

Highlighting is performed on a so-called `post limit` stage, meaning that snippet generation is postponed not just until the entire final result set is ready, but even after the LIMIT clause is applied. For example, with a LIMIT 20,10 clause, `HIGHLIGHT()` function will be called at most 10 times.

## Highlighting options

<!-- example highlighting options -->

There are several additional optional highlighting options that can be used to fine-tune snippet generation. Most of them are common to SQL, HTTP and PHP client.

#### before_match
A string to insert before a keyword match. A `%SNIPPET_ID%` macro can be used in this string. The first match of the macro is replaced with an incrementing snippet number within a current snippet. Numbering starts at 1 by default but can be overridden with `start_snippet_id` option. %SNIPPET_ID% restarts at the start of every new document. Default is `<b>`.
#### after_match
A string to insert after a keyword match. Default is `</b>`.
#### limit
Maximum snippet size, in symbols (codepoints). Default is 256. Per-field by default, see `limits_per_field`.
#### limit_words
Limits the maximum number of words that can be included in the result. Note the limit applies to any words, and not just the matched keywords to highlight. For example, if we are highlighting `Mary` and a snippet `Mary had a little lamb` is selected, then it contributes 5 words to this limit, not just 1. Default is 0 (no limit). Per-field by default, see `limits_per_field`.
#### limit_snippets
Limits the maximum number of snippets that can be included in the result. Default is 0 (no limit). Per-field by default, see `limits_per_field`.
#### limits_per_field
Selects whether `limit`, `limit_words` and `limit_snippets` work as individual limits in every field of the document being highlighted or as global limits for the whole document. Setting this option to 0 means that all combined highlighting results for one document must be within the specified limits.  The downside is that you may get several snippets highlighted in one field and none in another if the highlighting engine decides that they are more relevant. Default is 1 (use per-field limits).
#### around
How much words to pick around each matching keywords block. Default is 5.
#### use_boundaries
Whether to additionally break snippets by phrase boundary characters, as configured in index settings with [phrase_boundary](../Creating_an_index/NLP_and_tokenization/Low-level_tokenization.md#phrase_boundary) directive. Default is 0 (don't use boundaries).
#### weight_order
Whether to sort the extracted snippets in order of relevance (decreasing weight), or in order of appearance in the document (increasing position). Default is 0 (don't use weight order).
#### force_all_words
Ignores length limit until the result includes all the keywords. Default is 0 (don't force all keywords).
#### start_snippet_id
Specifies the starting value of `%SNIPPET_ID%` macro (that gets detected and expanded in `before_match`, `after_match` strings). Default is 1.
#### html_strip_mode
HTML stripping mode setting. Defaults to `index`, which means that index settings will be used. The other values are `none` and `strip`, that forcibly skip or apply stripping irregardless of index settings; and `retain`, that retains HTML markup and protects it from highlighting. The `retain` mode can only be used when highlighting full documents and thus requires that no snippet size limits are set. String, allowed values are `none`, `strip`, `index`, and `retain`.
#### allow_empty
Allows empty string to be returned as highlighting result when no snippets could be generated in the current field (no keywords match, or no snippets fit the limit). By default, the beginning of original text would be returned instead of an empty string. Default is 0 (don't allow empty result).
#### snippet_boundary
Ensures that snippets do not cross a sentence, paragraph, or zone boundary (when used with an index that has the respective indexing settings enabled). String, allowed values are `sentence`, `paragraph`, and `zone`.
#### emit_zones
Emits an HTML tag with an enclosing zone name before each snippet. Default is 0 (don't emit zone names).
#### force_snippets
Whether to force snippet generation even if limits allow to highlight whole text. Default is 0 (don't force snippet generation).

## Highlighting via SQL

`HIGHLIGHT()` function can be used to highlight search results. Here's the syntax:

```sql
HIGHLIGHT([options], [field_list], [query] )
```

<!-- example highlight() no args -->
By default, it works with no arguments.

<!-- intro -->
##### SQL:

<!-- request SQL -->

```sql
SELECT HIGHLIGHT() FROM books WHERE MATCH('before');
```

<!-- response SQL -->
```sql
+-----------------------------------------------------------+
| highlight()                                               |
+-----------------------------------------------------------+
| A door opened <b>before</b> them, revealing a small room. |
+-----------------------------------------------------------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
```

<!-- end -->

<!-- example highlight() field syntax -->

`HIGHLIGHT()` fetches all available full-text fields from document storage and highlights them against the given query. It supports field syntax in queries. Field text is separated by `field_separator`, which can be changed in the options.

<!-- intro -->
##### SQL:

<!-- request SQL -->

```sql
SELECT HIGHLIGHT() FROM books WHERE MATCH('@title one');
```

<!-- response SQL -->
```sql
+-----------------+
| highlight()     |
+-----------------+
| Book <b>one</b> |
+-----------------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
```

<!-- end -->

<!-- example highlight() options -->
Optional first argument in `HIGHLIGHT()` is the list of options.

<!-- intro -->
##### SQL:

<!-- request SQL -->

```sql
SELECT HIGHLIGHT({before_match='[match]',after_match='[/match]'}) FROM books WHERE MATCH('@title one');
```

<!-- response SQL -->
```sql
+------------------------------------------------------------+
| highlight({before_match='[match]',after_match='[/match]'}) |
+------------------------------------------------------------+
| Book [match]one[/match]                                    |
+------------------------------------------------------------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
```

<!-- end -->

<!-- example highlight() field list -->

Optional second argument is a string containing a field or a comma-separated list of fields. If this argument is present, only the specified fields will be fetched from document storage and highlighted. An empty string as a second argument means "fetch all available fields".

<!-- intro -->
##### SQL:

<!-- request SQL -->

```sql
SELECT HIGHLIGHT({},'title,content') FROM books WHERE MATCH('one|robots');
```

<!-- response SQL -->
```sql
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| highlight({},'title,content')                                                                                                                                                         |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Book <b>one</b> | They followed Bander. The <b>robots</b> remained at a polite distance, but their presence was a constantly felt threat.                                             |
| Bander ushered all three into the room. <b>One</b> of the <b>robots</b> followed as well. Bander gestured the other <b>robots</b> away and entered itself. The door closed behind it. |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
2 rows in set (0.00 sec)
```

<!-- end -->

<!-- example highlight() string attr -->

Another way to use the second argument is to specify string attribute or field name without quotes. This way the supplied string will be highlighted against the provided query, however, field syntax will be ignored.

<!-- intro -->
##### SQL:

<!-- request SQL -->

```sql
SELECT HIGHLIGHT({}, title) FROM books WHERE MATCH('one');
```

<!-- response SQL -->
```sql
+---------------------+
| highlight({},title) |
+---------------------+
| Book <b>one</b>     |
| Book five           |
+---------------------+
2 rows in set (0.00 sec)
```

<!-- end -->

<!-- example highlight() query -->

Optional third argument is the query. It is used to highlight search results against a query different than the one used for searching.

<!-- intro -->
##### SQL:

<!-- request SQL -->

```sql
SELECT HIGHLIGHT({},'title', 'five') FROM books WHERE MATCH('one');
```

<!-- response SQL -->
```sql
+-------------------------------+
| highlight({},'title', 'five') |
+-------------------------------+
| Book one                      |
| Book <b>five</b>              |
+-------------------------------+
2 rows in set (0.00 sec)
```

<!-- end -->

<!-- example HIGHLIGHT TO_STRING -->

While `HIGHLIGHT()` is designed to work with stored full-text fields and string attributes, it can also be used to highlight arbitrary text. Note that if the query has any field search operators (`@title hello @body world`), the field part of them is ignored in this case.

<!-- intro -->
##### SQL:

<!-- request SQL -->

```sql
SELECT HIGHLIGHT({},TO_STRING('some text to highlight'), 'highlight') FROM books WHERE MATCH('@title one');
```

<!-- response SQL -->
```sql
+----------------------------------------------------------------+
| highlight({},TO_STRING('some text to highlight'), 'highlight') |
+----------------------------------------------------------------+
| some text to <b>highlight</b>                                  |
+----------------------------------------------------------------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
```

<!-- end -->

Several options make sense only when generating a single string as a result (not an array of snippets). This only applies to SQL's `HIGHLIGHT()` function:

#### snippet_separator
A string to insert between snippets. Default is ` ... `.
#### field_separator
A string to insert between fields. Default is `|`.


Another way to highlight text is to use the [CALL SNIPPETS](../Searching/Highlighting.md#CALL-SNIPPETS) statement. It mostly duplicates `HIGHLIGHT()` functionality, but it can't use built-in document storage. It can, however, load source text from files.


## Highlighting via HTTP

<!-- example highlight in JSON -->

To highlight full-text search results in JSON queries via HTTP, field contents has to be stored in document storage (enabled by default). In the example full-text fields `content` and `title` are fetched from document storage and highlighted against the query specified in `query` clause.

Highlighted snippets are returned in the `highlight` property of the `hits` array.

<!-- intro -->
##### HTTP:

<!-- request HTTP -->

```json
POST /search
{
  "index": "books",

In addition to common highlighting options, several synonyms are available for JSON queries via HTTP:

#### fields
`fields` object contains attribute names with options. It can also be an array of field names (without any options).

Note, by default the highlighting works the way it tries to highlight the results following the full-text query. I.e. in a general case when you don't specify fields to highlight the highlight is based on your full-text query, but if you specify the fields to highlight it highlights only if the full-text query matches the selected fields.

#### encoder
`encoder` can be set to `default` or `html`. When set to `html`, retains html markup when highlighting. Works similar to `html_strip_mode=retain` option.

<!-- example highlight_query  -->
#### highlight_query
`highlight_query` makes it possible to highlight against a query other than our search query. Syntax is the same as in the main `query`.

`no_match_size` works similar to the `allow_empty` option. If set to 0, acts as `allow_empty=1`, i.e. allows empty string to be returned as 	highlighting result when a snippet could not be generated. Otherwise, the beginning of the field will be returned. Optional, default is 1.

Global limits can also be forced by specifying `limits_per_field=0`. Setting this option means that all combined highlighting results must be within the specified limits.

# CALL SNIPPETS

<!-- example CALL SNIPPETS -->

`CALL SNIPPETS` statement builds a snippet from provided data and query using specified index settings. It can't access built-in document storage, that's why it's recommended to use [HIGHLIGHT() function](../Searching/Highlighting.md) instead.

The syntax is:

```sql
CALL SNIPPETS(data, index, query[, opt_value AS opt_name[, ...]])
```

#### data
`data` is the source data to extract a snippet from. It can be a single string, or the list of the strings enclosed in curly brackets.
#### index
`index` is the name of the index from which to take the text processing settings.
#### query
`query` is the full-text query to build snippets for.
#### opt_value and opt_name
`opt_value` and `opt_name` are [snippet generation options](../Searching/Highlighting.md)

##### SQL:
<!-- request SQL -->

```sql
CALL SNIPPETS(('this is my document text','this is my another text'), 'forum', 'is text', 5 AS around, 200 AS limit);
```
<!-- response SQL -->
```sql
+----------------------------------------+
| snippet                                |
+----------------------------------------+
| this <b>is</b> my document <b>text</b> |
| this <b>is</b> my another <b>text</b>  |
+----------------------------------------+
2 rows in set (0.02 sec)

Most options are the same as in the [HIGHLIGHT() function](../Searching/Highlighting.md). There are, however, several options that can only be used with `CALL SNIPPETS`.

<!-- example CALL SNIPPETS load files -->
The following options can be used to highlight text stored in separate files:

#### load_files
Whether to handle the first argument as data to extract snippets from (default behavior), or to treat it as file names, and load data from specified files on the server side. Up to [max_threads_per_query](../Server_settings/Searchd.md#max_threads_per_query) worker threads per request will be used to parallelize the work when this flag is enabled. Default is 0 (no limit). To distribute snippet generation between remote agents invoke snippets generation in a distributed index, that contains only one(!) local agent and several remotes. The [snippets_file_prefix](../Creating_an_index/Creating_a_distributed_index/Remote_indexes.md#snippets_file_prefix) option is used to generate the final file name. E.g. when searchd is configured with `snippets_file_prefix = /var/data_` and `text.txt` is provided as a file name, snippets will be generated from the content of `/var/data_text.txt`.

#### load_files_scattered
Works only with distributed snippets generation with remote agents. Source files for snippet generation can be distributed among different agents and the main server will merge all non-erroneous results. E.g. if one agent of the distributed index has `file1.txt`, another agent has `file2.txt` and you use `CALL SNIPPETS` with both of these files, searchd will merge agent results, so you will get results from both `file1.txt` and `file2.txt`. Default is 0.

If `load_files` options is also enabled, request will return an error if any of the files is not available anywhere. Otherwise (if `load_files` is not enabled) it will just return empty strings for all absent files. Searchd does not pass this flag to agents, so agents do not generate a critical error if the file does not exist. If you want to be sure that all source files are loaded, set both `load_files_scattered` and `load_files` to 1. If the absence of some source files on some agent is not critical, set only `load_files_scattered` to 1.
