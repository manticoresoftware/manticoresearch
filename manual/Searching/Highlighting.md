# Highlighting

<!-- example highlighting -->

Highlighting enables you to obtain highlighted text fragments (referred to as snippets) from documents containing matching keywords.

The SQL `HIGHLIGHT()` function, the `"highlight"` property in JSON queries via HTTP, and the `highlight()` function in the PHP client all utilize the built-in document storage to retrieve the original field contents (enabled by default).

When using SQL for highlighting search results, you will receive snippets from various fields combined into a single string due to the limitations of the MySQL protocol. You can adjust the concatenation separators with the `field_separator` and `snippet_separator` options, as detailed below.

When executing JSON queries through HTTP or using the PHP client, there are no such constraints, and the result set includes an array of fields containing arrays of snippets (without separators).

Keep in mind that snippet generation options like `limit`, `limit_words`, and `limit_snippets` apply to each field individually by default. You can alter this behavior using the `limits_per_field` option, but it could lead to unwanted results. For example, one field may have matching keywords, but no snippets from that field are included in the result set because they didn't rank as high as snippets from other fields in the highlighting engine.

The highlighting algorithm currently prioritizes better snippets (with closer phrase matches) and then snippets with keywords not yet included in the result. Generally, it aims to highlight the best match for the query and to highlight all query keywords, as allowed by the limits. If no matches are found in the current field, the beginning of the document will be trimmed according to the limits and returned by default. To return an empty string instead, set the `allow_empty` option to 1.

Highlighting is performed during the so-called `post limit` stage, which means that snippet generation is deferred not only until the entire final result set is prepared but also after the LIMIT clause is applied. For instance, with a LIMIT 20,10 clause, the `HIGHLIGHT()` function will be called a maximum of 10 times.

## Highlighting options

<!-- example highlighting options -->

There are several optional highlighting options that can be used to fine-tune snippet generation, which are common to SQL, HTTP, and PHP clients.

#### before_match
A string to insert before a keyword match. The `%SNIPPET_ID%` macro can be used in this string. The first occurrence of the macro is replaced with an incrementing snippet number within the current snippet. Numbering starts at 1 by default but can be overridden with the `start_snippet_id` option. %SNIPPET_ID% restarts at the beginning of each new document. The default is `<b>`.

#### after_match
A string to insert after a keyword match. The default is `</b>`.

#### limit
The maximum snippet size, in symbols (codepoints). The default is 256. This is applied per-field by default, see `limits_per_field`.

#### limit_words
Limits the maximum number of words that can be included in the result. Note that this limit applies to all words, not just the matched keywords to highlight. For example, if highlighting `Mary` and a snippet `Mary had a little lamb` is selected, it contributes 5 words to this limit, not just 1. The default is 0 (no limit). This is applied per-field by default, see `limits_per_field`.

#### limit_snippets
Limits the maximum number of snippets that can be included in the result. The default is 0 (no limit). This is applied per-field by default, see `limits_per_field`.

#### limits_per_field
Determines whether `limit`, `limit_words`, and `limit_snippets` operate as individual limits in each field of the document being highlighted or as global limits for the entire document. Setting this option to 0 means that all combined highlighting results for one document must be within the specified limits. The downside is that you may have several snippets highlighted in one field and none in another if the highlighting engine decides they are more relevant. The default is 1 (use per-field limits).
#### around
The number of words to select around each matching keyword block. The default is 5.

#### use_boundaries
Determines whether to additionally break snippets by phrase boundary characters, as configured in table settings with the [phrase_boundary](../Creating_a_table/NLP_and_tokenization/Low-level_tokenization.md#phrase_boundary) directive. The default is 0 (don't use boundaries).

#### weight_order
Specifies whether to sort the extracted snippets in order of relevance (decreasing weight) or in order of appearance in the document (increasing position). The default is 0 (don't use weight order).

#### force_all_words
Ignores the length limit until the result includes all keywords. The default is 0 (don't force all keywords).

#### start_snippet_id
Sets the starting value of the `%SNIPPET_ID%` macro (which is detected and expanded in `before_match`, `after_match` strings). The default is 1.

#### html_strip_mode
Defines the HTML stripping mode setting. Defaults to `index`, meaning that table settings will be used. Other values include `none` and `strip`, which forcibly skip or apply stripping regardless of table settings; and `retain`, which retains HTML markup and protects it from highlighting. The `retain` mode can only be used when highlighting full documents and therefore requires that no snippet size limits are set. The allowed string values are `none`, `strip`, `index`, and `retain`.

#### allow_empty
Permits an empty string to be returned as the highlighting result when no snippets could be generated in the current field (no keyword match or no snippets fit the limit). By default, the beginning of the original text would be returned instead of an empty string. The default is 0 (don't allow an empty result).

#### snippet_boundary
Ensures that snippets do not cross a sentence, paragraph, or zone boundary (when used with a table that has the respective indexing settings enabled). The allowed values are `sentence`, `paragraph`, and `zone`.

#### emit_zones
Emits an HTML tag with the enclosing zone name before each snippet. The default is 0 (don't emit zone names).

#### force_snippets
Determines whether to force snippet generation even if limits allow highlighting the entire text. The default is 0 (don't force snippet generation).

## Highlighting via SQL

The `HIGHLIGHT()` function can be used to highlight search results. Here's the syntax:

```sql
HIGHLIGHT([options], [field_list], [query] )
```

<!-- example highlight() no args -->
By default, it works with no arguments.

<!-- intro -->
##### SQL:

<!-- request SQL -->

```sql
SELECT HIGHLIGHT() FROM books WHERE MATCH('before');
```

<!-- response SQL -->
```sql
+-----------------------------------------------------------+
| highlight()                                               |
+-----------------------------------------------------------+
| A door opened <b>before</b> them, revealing a small room. |
+-----------------------------------------------------------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
```

<!-- end -->

<!-- example highlight() field syntax -->

`HIGHLIGHT()` retrieves all available full-text fields from document storage and highlights them against the provided query. Field syntax in queries is supported. Field text is separated by `field_separator`, which can be modified in the options.

<!-- intro -->
##### SQL:

<!-- request SQL -->

```sql
SELECT HIGHLIGHT() FROM books WHERE MATCH('@title one');
```

<!-- response SQL -->
```sql
+-----------------+
| highlight()     |
+-----------------+
| Book <b>one</b> |
+-----------------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
```

<!-- end -->

<!-- example highlight() options -->
Optional first argument in `HIGHLIGHT()` is the list of options.

<!-- intro -->
##### SQL:

<!-- request SQL -->

```sql
SELECT HIGHLIGHT({before_match='[match]',after_match='[/match]'}) FROM books WHERE MATCH('@title one');
```

<!-- response SQL -->
```sql
+------------------------------------------------------------+
| highlight({before_match='[match]',after_match='[/match]'}) |
+------------------------------------------------------------+
| Book [match]one[/match]                                    |
+------------------------------------------------------------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
```

<!-- end -->

<!-- example highlight() field list -->

The optional second argument is a string containing a single field or a comma-separated list of fields. If this argument is present, only the specified fields will be fetched from document storage and highlighted. An empty string as the second argument signifies "fetch all available fields."

<!-- intro -->
##### SQL:

<!-- request SQL -->

```sql
SELECT HIGHLIGHT({},'title,content') FROM books WHERE MATCH('one|robots');
```

<!-- response SQL -->
```sql
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| highlight({},'title,content')                                                                                                                                                         |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Book <b>one</b> | They followed Bander. The <b>robots</b> remained at a polite distance, but their presence was a constantly felt threat.                                             |
| Bander ushered all three into the room. <b>One</b> of the <b>robots</b> followed as well. Bander gestured the other <b>robots</b> away and entered itself. The door closed behind it. |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
2 rows in set (0.00 sec)
```

<!-- end -->

<!-- example highlight() string attr -->

Alternatively, you can use the second argument to specify a string attribute or field name without quotes. In this case, the supplied string will be highlighted against the provided query, but field syntax will be ignored.

<!-- intro -->
##### SQL:

<!-- request SQL -->

```sql
SELECT HIGHLIGHT({}, title) FROM books WHERE MATCH('one');
```

<!-- response SQL -->
```sql
+---------------------+
| highlight({},title) |
+---------------------+
| Book <b>one</b>     |
| Book five           |
+---------------------+
2 rows in set (0.00 sec)
```

<!-- end -->

<!-- example highlight() query -->

The optional third argument is the query. This is used to highlight search results against a query different from the one used for searching.

<!-- intro -->
##### SQL:

<!-- request SQL -->

```sql
SELECT HIGHLIGHT({},'title', 'five') FROM books WHERE MATCH('one');
```

<!-- response SQL -->
```sql
+-------------------------------+
| highlight({},'title', 'five') |
+-------------------------------+
| Book one                      |
| Book <b>five</b>              |
+-------------------------------+
2 rows in set (0.00 sec)
```

<!-- end -->

<!-- example HIGHLIGHT TO_STRING -->

Although `HIGHLIGHT()` is designed to work with stored full-text fields and string attributes, it can also be used to highlight arbitrary text. Keep in mind that if the query contains any field search operators (e.g., `@title hello @body world`), the field part of them is ignored in this case.

<!-- intro -->
##### SQL:

<!-- request SQL -->

```sql
SELECT HIGHLIGHT({},TO_STRING('some text to highlight'), 'highlight') FROM books WHERE MATCH('@title one');
```

<!-- response SQL -->
```sql
+----------------------------------------------------------------+
| highlight({},TO_STRING('some text to highlight'), 'highlight') |
+----------------------------------------------------------------+
| some text to <b>highlight</b>                                  |
+----------------------------------------------------------------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
```

<!-- end -->

Several options are relevant only when generating a single string as a result (not an array of snippets). This applies exclusively to the SQL `HIGHLIGHT()` function:

#### snippet_separator
A string to insert between snippets. The default is ` ... `.
#### field_separator
A string to insert between fields. The default is `|`.


Another way to highlight text is to use the [CALL SNIPPETS](../Searching/Highlighting.md#CALL-SNIPPETS) statement. This mostly duplicates the `HIGHLIGHT()` functionality but cannot use built-in document storage. However, it can load source text from files.


## Highlighting via HTTP

<!-- example highlight in JSON -->

To highlight full-text search results in JSON queries via HTTP, field contents must be stored in document storage (enabled by default). In the example, full-text fields `content` and `title` are fetched from document storage and highlighted against the query specified in the `query` clause.

Highlighted snippets are returned in the `highlight` property of the `hits` array.

#### fields
The `fields` object contains attribute names with options. It can also be an array of field names (without any options).

Note that by default, highlighting attempts to highlight the results following the full-text query. In a general case, when you don't specify fields to highlight, the highlight is based on your full-text query. However, if you specify fields to highlight, it highlights only if the full-text query matches the selected fields.

#### encoder
The `encoder` can be set to `default` or `html`. When set to `html`, it retains HTML markup when highlighting. This works similarly to the `html_strip_mode=retain` option.

<!-- example highlight_query -->
#### highlight_query
The `highlight_query` option allows you to highlight against a query other than your search query. The syntax is the same as in the main `query`.

#### no_match_size
`no_match_size` functions similarly to the `allow_empty` option. If set to 0, it acts as `allow_empty=1`, allowing an empty string to be returned as a highlighting result when a snippet could not be generated. Otherwise, the beginning of the field will be returned. This is optional, with a default value of 1.

#### limits_per_field
Global limits can also be enforced by specifying `limits_per_field=0`. Setting this option means that all combined highlighting results must be within the specified limits. The downside is that you may get several snippets highlighted in one field and none in another if the highlighting engine decides that they are more relevant.

# CALL SNIPPETS

<!-- example CALL SNIPPETS -->

The `CALL SNIPPETS` statement builds a snippet from provided data and query using specified table settings. It can't access built-in document storage, which is why it's recommended to use the [HIGHLIGHT() function](../Searching/Highlighting.md) instead.

The syntax is:

```sql
CALL SNIPPETS(data, table, query[, opt_value AS opt_name[, ...]])
```

#### data
`data` serves as the source from which a snippet is extracted. It can either be a single string or a list of strings enclosed in curly brackets.
#### table
`table` refers to the name of the table that provides the text processing settings for snippet generation.
#### query
`query` is the full-text query used to build the snippets.
#### opt_value and opt_name
`opt_value` and `opt_name` represent the [snippet generation options](../Searching/Highlighting.md).

<!-- intro -->
##### SQL:
<!-- request SQL -->

```sql
CALL SNIPPETS(('this is my document text','this is my another text'), 'forum', 'is text', 5 AS around, 200 AS limit);
```
<!-- response SQL -->
```sql
+----------------------------------------+
| snippet                                |
+----------------------------------------+
| this <b>is</b> my document <b>text</b> |
| this <b>is</b> my another <b>text</b>  |
+----------------------------------------+

<!-- end -->

Most options are the same as in the [HIGHLIGHT() function](../Searching/Highlighting.md). There are, however, several options that can only be used with `CALL SNIPPETS`.

<!-- example CALL SNIPPETS load files -->
The following options can be used to highlight text stored in separate files:

#### load_files
This option, when enabled, treats the first argument as file names instead of data to extract snippets from. The specified files on the server side will be loaded for data. Up to [max_threads_per_query](../Server_settings/Searchd.md#max_threads_per_query) worker threads per request will be used to parallelize the work when this flag is enabled. Default is 0 (no limit). To distribute snippet generation between remote agents, invoke snippets generation in a distributed table containing only one(!) local agent and several remotes. The [snippets_file_prefix](../Creating_a_table/Creating_a_distributed_table/Remote_tables.md#snippets_file_prefix) option is used to generate the final file name. For example, when searchd is configured with `snippets_file_prefix = /var/data_` and `text.txt` is provided as a file name, snippets will be generated from the content of `/var/data_text.txt`.

#### load_files_scattered
This option only works with distributed snippets generation with remote agents. Source files for snippet generation can be distributed among different agents, and the main server will merge all non-erroneous results. For example, if one agent of the distributed table has `file1.txt`, another agent has `file2.txt`, and you use `CALL SNIPPETS` with both of these files, searchd will merge agent results, so you will get results from both `file1.txt` and `file2.txt`. Default is 0.

If the `load_files` option is also enabled, the request will return an error if any of the files is not available anywhere. Otherwise (if `load_files` is not enabled), it will return empty strings for all absent files. Searchd does not pass this flag to agents, so agents do not generate a critical error if the file does not exist. If you want to be sure that all source files are loaded, set both `load_files_scattered` and `load_files` to 1. If the absence of some source files on some agent is not critical, set only `load_files_scattered` to 1.
