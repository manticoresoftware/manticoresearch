# K-nearest neighbor vector search

Manticore Search supports the ability to add embeddings generated by your Machine Learning models to each document, and then doing a nearest-neighbor search on them. This lets you build features like similarity search, recommendations, semantic search, and relevance ranking based on NLP algorithms, among others, including image, video, and sound searches.

## What is an embedding?

An embedding is a method of representing data—such as text, images, or sound—as vectors in a high-dimensional space. These vectors are crafted to ensure that the distance between them reflects the similarity of the data they represent. This process typically employs algorithms like word embeddings (e.g., Word2Vec, BERT) for text or neural networks for images. The high-dimensional nature of the vector space, with many components per vector, allows for the representation of complex and nuanced relationships between items. Their similarity is gauged by the distance between these vectors, often measured using methods like Euclidean distance or cosine similarity.

Manticore Search enables k-nearest neighbor (KNN) vector searches using the HNSW library. This functionality is part of the [Manticore Columnar Library](https://github.com/manticoresoftware/columnar).

### Configuring a table for KNN search

To run KNN searches, you must first configure your table. It needs to have at least one float_vector attribute, which serves as a data vector. You need to specify the following properties:
* `knn_type`: A mandatory setting; currently, only `hnsw` is supported.
* `knn_dims`: A mandatory setting that specifies the dimensions of the vectors being indexed.
* `hnsw_similarity`: A mandatory setting that specifies the distance function used by the HNSW index. Acceptable values are:
  - `L2` - Squared L2
  - `IP` - Inner product
  - `COSINE` - Cosine similarity
* `hnsw_m`: An optional setting that defines the maximum number of outgoing connections in the graph. The default is 16.
* `hnsw_ef_construction`: An optional setting that defines a construction time/accuracy trade-off.

##### SQL:

<!-- request SQL -->

```sql
create table test ( title text, image_vector float_vector knn_type='hnsw' knn_dims='4' hnsw_similarity='l2' );
```
<!-- response -->

```sql
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.01 sec)
```
<!-- end -->

<!-- example knn_insert -->

### Inserting vector data

After creating the table, you need to insert your vector data, ensuring it matches the dimensions you specified when creating the table.

<!-- intro -->
##### SQL:

<!-- request SQL -->

```sql
insert into test values ( 1, 'yellow bag', (0.653448,0.192478,0.017971,0.339821) ), ( 2, 'white bag', (-0.148894,0.748278,0.091892,-0.095406) );
```
<!-- response SQL -->

```sql
Query OK, 2 rows affected (0.00 sec)
```

##### JSON:

<!-- request JSON -->

```json
POST /insert
{
	"index":"test_vec",
	"id":1,
	"doc": 	{ "title" : "yellow bag", "image_vector" : [0.653448,0.192478,0.017971,0.339821] }
}

POST /insert
{
	"index":"test_vec",
	"id":2,
	"doc": 	{ "title" : "white bag", "image_vector" : [-0.148894,0.748278,0.091892,-0.095406] }
}
```

}

### KNN vector search

Now, you can perform a KNN search using the `knn` clause in either SQL or JSON format. Both interfaces support the same essential parameters, ensuring a consistent experience regardless of the format you choose:

- SQL: `select ... from <table name> where knn ( <field>, <k>, <query vector> )`
- JSON:
  ```
  POST /search
  {
      "index": "<table name>",
      "knn":
      {
          "field": "<field>"",
          "query_vector": [<query vector>],
          "k": <k>
      }
  }
  ```

The parameters are:
* `field`: This is the name of the float vector attribute containing vector data.
* `k`: This represents the number of documents to return. It indicates how many documents a single Hierarchical Navigable Small World (HNSW) index will return. The actual result may include more documents than `k` (e.g., if each disk chunk in a real-time table returns `k` documents, the total would be `num_chunks * k` documents). Conversely, the result might contain fewer than `k` documents if, for example, you request `k` documents and subsequently filter them by some attribute.
* `query_vector`: This is the search vector.

Documents are always sorted by their distance to the search vector. Any additional sorting criteria you specify will be applied after this primary sort condition. For retrieving the distance, there is a built-in function called [knn_dist()](../Functions/Other_functions.md#KNN_DIST%28%29).

### Search KNN similar docs

The ManticoreSearch algorithm excels in identifying analogous KNN documents already existing within your index.


- SQL: `select ... from <table name> where knn ( <field>, <k>, <document id> )`
- JSON:
  ```
  POST /search
  {
      "index": "<table name>",
      "knn":
      {
          "field": "<field>",
          "doc_id": <document id>,
          "k": <k>
      }
  }
  ```

The parameters are:
* `field`: This is the name of the float vector attribute containing vector data.
* `k`: This represents the number of documents to return. It indicates how many documents a single Hierarchical Navigable Small World (HNSW) index will return. The actual result may include more documents than `k` (e.g., if each disk chunk in a real-time table returns `k` documents, the total would be `num_chunks * k` documents). Conversely, the result might contain fewer than `k` documents if, for example, you request `k` documents and subsequently filter them by some attribute.
* `document id`: Document ID for KNN similarity search:
