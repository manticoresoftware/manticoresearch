# Backup and Restore

Backing up your tables on a regular basis is essential for recovery in the event of system crashes, hardware failure, or data corruption/loss. It's also highly recommended to make backups before upgrading to a new Manticore Search version or running [ALTER TABLE](../Updating_table_schema_and_settings.md#Updating-table-schema-in-RT-mode).

Backing up database systems can be done in two unique ways: logical and physical backups. Each of these methods has its pros and cons, which may vary based on the specific database environment and needs. Here, we'll delve into the distinction between these two types of backups.

### Logical Backups

Logical backups entail exporting the database schema and data as SQL statements or as data formats specific to the database. This backup form is typically readable by humans and can be employed to restore the database on various systems or database engines.

Pros and cons of logical backups:
- ➕ **Portability:** Logical backups are generally more portable than physical backups, as they can be used to restore the database on different hardware or operating systems.
- ➕ **Flexibility:** Logical backups allow you to selectively restore specific tables, indexes, or other database objects.
- ➕ **Compatibility:** Logical backups can be used to migrate data between different database management systems or versions, provided the target system supports the exported format or SQL statements.
- ➖ **Slower Backup and Restore:** Logical backups can be slower than physical backups, as they require the database engine to convert the data into SQL statements or another export format.
- ➖ **Increased System Load:** Creating logical backups can cause higher system load, as the process requires more CPU and memory resources to process and export the data.

Manticore Search supports [mysqldump](../Securing_and_compacting_a_table/Backup_and_restore.md#Backup-and-restore-with-mysqldump) for logical backups.

### Physical Backups

Physical backups involve copying the raw data files and system files that comprise the database. This type of backup essentially creates a snapshot of the database's physical state at a given point in time.

Pros and cons of physical backups:
- ➕ **Speed:** Physical backups are usually faster than logical backups, as they involve copying raw data files directly from disk.
- ➕ **Consistency:** Physical backups ensure a consistent backup of the entire database, as all related files are copied together.
- ➕ **Lower System Load:** Creating physical backups generally places less load on the system compared to logical backups, as the process does not involve additional data processing.
- ➖ **Portability:** Physical backups are typically less portable than logical backups, as they may be dependent on the specific hardware, operating system, or database engine configuration.
- ➖ **Flexibility:** Physical backups do not allow for the selective restoration of specific database objects, as the backup contains the entire database's raw files.
- ➖ **Compatibility:** Physical backups cannot be used to migrate data between different database management systems or versions, as the raw data files may not be compatible across different platforms or software.

Manticore Search has [manticore-backup](../Securing_and_compacting_a_table/Backup_and_restore.md#Using-manticore-backup-command-line-tool) command line tool for physical backups.

In summary, logical backups provide more flexibility, portability, and compatibility but can be slower and more resource-intensive, while physical backups are faster, more consistent, and less resource-intensive but may be limited in terms of portability and flexibility. The choice between these two backup methods will depend on your specific database environment, hardware, and requirements.

## Using manticore-backup command line tool

The `manticore-backup` tool, included in the official Manticore Search [packages](https://manticoresearch.com/install), automates the process of backing up tables for an instance running in [RT mode](../Read_this_first.md#Real-time-mode-vs-plain-mode).

### Installation

**If you followed [the official installation instructions](https://manticoresearch.com/install/), you should already have everything installed and don't need to worry.** Otherwise, [`manticore-backup`](https://github.com/manticoresoftware/manticoresearch-backup) requires PHP 8.1.10 and [specific modules](https://github.com/manticoresoftware/executor/blob/main/build-linux) or [`manticore-executor`](https://github.com/manticoresoftware/executor), which is a part of the `manticore-extra` package, and you need to ensure that one of these is available.

Note that `manticore-backup` is not available for Windows yet.

### How to use

First, make sure you're running `manticore-backup` on the same server where the Manticore instance you are about to back up is running.

Second, we recommend running the tool under the `root` user so the tool can transfer ownership of the files you are backing up. Otherwise, a backup will be also made but with no ownership transfer. In either case, you should make sure that `manticore-backup` has access to the data dir of the Manticore instance.

<!-- example backup1 -->

The only required argument for `manticore-backup` is `--backup-dir`, which specifies the destination for the backup. If you don't provide any additional arguments, `manticore-backup` will:
- locate a Manticore instance running with the default configuration
- create a subdirectory in the `--backup-dir` directory with a timestamped name
- backup all tables found in the instance

<!-- request Example -->
```bash
manticore-backup --config=path/to/manticore.conf --backup-dir=backupdir
```

### Arguments

| Argument | Description |
|-|-|
| `--backup-dir=path` | This is the path to the backup directory where the backup will be stored. The directory must already exist. This argument is required and has no default value. On each backup run, manticore-backup will create a subdirectory in the provided directory with a timestamp in the name (`backup-[datetime]`), and will copy all required tables to it. So the `--backup-dir` is a container for all your backups, and it's safe to run the script multiple times.|
| `--restore[=backup]` | Restore from `--backup-dir`. Just --restore lists available backups. `--restore=backup` will restore from `<--backup-dir>/backup`. |
| `--force` | Skip versions check on restore and gracefully restore the backup. |
| `--disable-telemetry` | Pass this flag in case you want to disable sending anonymized metrics  to Manticore. You can also use environment variable TELEMETRY=0 |
| `--config=/path/to/manticore.conf` | Path to the Manticore configuration. Optional. If not provided, a default configuration for your operating system will be used. Used to determine the host and port for communication with the Manticore daemon. The `manticore-backup` tool supports [dynamic configuration](../Server_settings/Scripted_configuration.md) files. You can specify the `--config` option multiple times if your configuration is spread across multiple files. |
| `--tables=tbl1,tbl2, ...` | Semicolon-separated list of tables that you want to back up. To back up all tables, omit this argument. All the provided tables must exist in the Manticore instance you are backing up from, or the backup will fail. |
| `--compress` | Whether the backed up files should be compressed. Not enabled by default. | optional |
| `--unlock` | In rare cases when something goes wrong, tables can be left in a locked state. Use this argument to unlock them. |
| `--version` | Show the current version. |
| `--help` | Show this help. |

## BACKUP SQL command reference

You can also back up your data through SQL by running the simple command `BACKUP TO /path/to/backup`.

Note, this command is not supported in Windows yet.

### General syntax of BACKUP

```sql
BACKUP
  [{TABLE | TABLES} a[, b]]
  [{OPTION | OPTIONS}
    async = {on | off | 1 | 0 | true | false | yes | no}
    [, compress = {on | off | 1 | 0 | true | false | yes | no}]
  ]
  TO path_to_backup
```

For instance, to back up tables `a` and `b` to the `/backup` directory, run the following command:

```sql
BACKUP TABLES a, b TO /backup
```

There are options available to control and adjust the backup process, such as:

* `async`: makes the backup non-blocking, allowing you to receive a response with the query ID immediately and run other queries while the backup is ongoing. The default value is `0`.
* `compress`: enables file compression using zstd. The default value is `0`.
For example, to run a backup of all tables in async mode with compression enabled to the `/tmp` directory:

```sql
BACKUP OPTION async = yes, compress = yes TO /tmp
```

### Important considerations

1. The path should not contain special symbols or spaces, as they are not supported.
2. Ensure that Manticore Buddy is launched (it is by default).

### How backup maintains consistency of tables

To ensure consistency of tables during backup, Manticore Search's backup tools use the innovative [FREEZE and UNFREEZE](../Securing_and_compacting_a_table/Freezing_a_table.md) commands. Unlike the traditional lock and unlock tables feature of e.g. MySQL, `FREEZE` stops flushing data to disk while still permitting writing (to some extent) and selecting updated data from the table.

However, if your RAM chunk size grows beyond the `rt_mem_limit` threshold during lengthy backup operations involving many inserts, data may be flushed to disk, and write operations will be blocked until flushing is complete. Despite this, the tool maintains a balance between table locking, data consistency, and database write availability while the table is frozen.

When you use `manticore-backup` or the SQL `BACKUP` command, the `FREEZE` command is executed once and freezes all tables you are backing up simultaneously. The backup process subsequently backs up each table one by one, releasing the freeze after successfully backing up each table.

If backup fails or gets interrupted, the tool tries to unfreeze all the tables.

## Restore by using manticore-backup tool

<!-- example restore_list -->
To restore a Manticore instance from a backup, use the `manticore-backup` command with the `--backup-dir` and `--restore` arguments. For example: `manticore-backup --backup-dir=/path/to/backups --restore`. If you don't provide any argument for `--restore`, it will simply list all the backups in the `--backup-dir`.

<!-- request Example -->
```bash
manticore-backup --backup-dir=/mnt/backup/ --restore
```

<!-- response Example -->

```bash
Copyright (c) 2023-2024, Manticore Software LTD (https://manticoresearch.com)

Manticore config file:
Backup dir: /tmp/

Available backups: 3
  backup-20221006144635 (Oct 06 2022 14:46:35)
  backup-20221006145233 (Oct 06 2022 14:52:33)
  backup-20221007104044 (Oct 07 2022 10:40:44)
```

<!-- end -->

<!-- example restore -->

To start a restore job, run `manticore-backup` with the flag `--restore=backup name`, where `backup name` is the name of the backup directory within the `--backup-dir`. Note that:
1. There can't be any Manticore instance running on the same host and port as the one being restored.
2. The old `manticore.json` file must not exist.
3. The old configuration file must not exist.
4. The old data directory must exist and be empty.

If all conditions are met, the restore will proceed. The tool will provide hints, so you don't have to memorize them. It's crucial to avoid overwriting existing files, so make sure to remove them prior to the restore if they still exist. Hence all the conditions.

<!-- request Example -->
```bash
manticore-backup --backup-dir=/mnt/backup/ --restore=backup-20221007104044
```

<!-- response Example -->

## Backup and restore with mysqldump

<!-- example mysqldump_backup -->
To create a backup of your Manticore Search database, you can use the `mysqldump` command. We will use the default port and host in the examples.

Note, `mysqldump` is supported only for real-time tables.

<!-- request Example -->
```bash
mysqldump -h0 -P9306 manticore > manticore_backup.sql
mariadb-dump -h0 -P9306 manticore > manticore_backup.sql
```

Executing this command will produce a backup file named `manticore_backup.sql`. This file will hold all data and table schemas.

<!-- request Example 2 -->
```bash
mysqldump -h0 -P9306 --replace --net-buffer-length=16m -etc manticore tbl > tbl.sql
```

This will produce a backup file `tbl.sql` with `replace` commands instead of `insert`, with column names retained in each batch. Documents will be batched up to 16 megabytes large. There will be no `drop`/`create table` commands. This is useful for full-text reindexation after changing tokenization settings.
<!-- end -->

<!-- example mysqldump_restore -->
### Restore

If you're looking to restore a Manticore Search database from a backup file, the mysql client is your tool of choice.

Note, if you are restoring in [Plain mode](../Read_this_first.md#Real-time-mode-vs-plain-mode), you cannot drop and recreate tables directly. Therefore, you should:
- Use `mysqldump` with the `-t` option to exclude `CREATE TABLE` statements from your backup.
- Manually [TRUNCATE](../Emptying_a_table.md) the tables before proceeding with the restoration.

<!-- request SQL -->
```bash
mysql -h0 -P9306 < manticore_backup.sql
mariadb -h0 -P9306 < manticore_backup.sql
```

This command enables you to restore everything from the `manticore_backup.sql` file.
<!-- end -->

### Additional options

Here are some more settings that can be used with mysqldump to tailor your backup:

- `-t` skips `drop`/`create` table commands. Useful for full-text reindexation of a table after changing tokenization settings.
- `--no-data`: This setting omits table data from the backup, resulting in a backup file that consists only of table schemas.
- `--ignore-table=[database_name].[table_name]`: This option allows you to bypass a particular table during the backup operation. Note that the database name must be `manticore`.
- `--replace` to perform `replace` instead of `insert`. Useful for full-text reindexation of a table after changing tokenization settings.
- `--net-buffer-length=16M` to make batches up to 16 megabytes large for faster restoration.
- `-e` to batch up documents. Useful for faster restoration.
- `-c` to keep column names. Useful for reindexation of a table after changing its schema (e.g., changing field order).

For a comprehensive list of settings and their thorough descriptions, kindly refer to the [official MySQL documentation](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/mysqldump.html).

### Notes

We recommend specifying the `manticore` database explicitly when you plan to back up all databases, rather than using the `--all-databases` option.

Keep in mind that `mysqldump` does not support backing up distributed tables. Additionally, it cannot back up tables that contain non-stored fields (consider using `manticore-backup` or the `BACKUP` SQL command).
