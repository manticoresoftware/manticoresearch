# Flushing RAM chunk to a new disk chunk

## FLUSH RAMCHUNK

<!-- example flush_ramchunk -->

```sql
FLUSH RAMCHUNK rt_table
```

The `FLUSH RAMCHUNK` command creates a new disk chunk in an RT table.

Normally, an RT table automatically flushes and converts the contents of the RAM chunk into a new disk chunk when one of the [special conditions](../Creating_a_table/Local_tables/Plain_and_real-time_table_settings.md#ram-chunk-flushing-conditions) is met. In some cases, though, you may want to trigger the flush manually â€” and the `FLUSH RAMCHUNK` statement lets you do that.
