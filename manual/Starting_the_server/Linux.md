# Starting Manticore in Linux

When Manticore Search is installed using DEB or RPM packages, the searchd process can be run and managed by the operating system's init system. Most Linux versions now use systemd, while older releases use SysV init.

To check which init system your platform uses, run the following command:

```shell
ps --no-headers -o comm 1
```
This will display the name of the process that is running as the init process, which can be used to determine the init system in use.

### Starting and stopping using systemd

After the installation the Manticore Search service is not started automatically. To start Manticore run the following command:

```shell
sudo systemctl start manticore
```

To stop Manticore run the following command:


```shell
sudo systemctl stop manticore
```

The Manticore service is set to run at boot. You can check it by running:

```shell
sudo systemctl is-enabled manticore
```

If you want to disable Manticore from starting at boot time, run:

```bash
sudo systemctl disable manticore
```

To make Manticore start at boot, run:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable manticore
```

If you still need the generator again, just install the Manticore packages again and it will recover the generator file.

`searchd` process logs startup information in `systemd` journal. If `systemd` logging is enabled you can view the logged information with the following command:

```shell
sudo journalctl --unit manticore
```

### Custom startup flags using systemd

`systemctl set-environment _ADDITIONAL_SEARCHD_PARAMS`  allows you to specify custom startup flags that the Manticore Search daemon should be started with. See full list [here](../Starting_the_server/Manually.md#searchd-command-line-options).

For example, to start Manticore with the debug logging level, you can run:
```bash
systemctl set-environment _ADDITIONAL_SEARCHD_PARAMS='--logdebug'
systemctl restart manticore
```

To undo it, run:
```bash
systemctl set-environment _ADDITIONAL_SEARCHD_PARAMS=''
systemctl restart manticore
```

Note, systemd environment variables get reset on server reboot.

### Starting and stopping using service

Manticore can be started and stopped using service commands:

```shell
sudo service manticore start
sudo service manticore stop
```

To enable the sysV service at boot on RedHat systems run:

```shell
chkconfig manticore on
```

To enable the sysV service at boot on Debian systems (including Ubuntu) run:

```shell
update-rc.d manticore defaults
```

Please note that `searchd` is started by the init system under the `manticore` user and all files created by the server will be owned by this user. If `searchd` is started under, for example, the root user, the file permissions will be changed, which may result in issues when running `searchd` as a service again.
