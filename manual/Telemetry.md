# Telemetry

At Manticore, we gather various anonymized metrics to enhance the quality of our products, including Manticore Search. By analyzing this data, we can not only improve the overall performance of our product but also identify which features would be most beneficial to prioritize in order to provide even more value to our users. The telemetry system operates on a separate thread in a non-blocking mode, taking snapshots and sending them once every few minutes.

We take your privacy seriously, and you can rest assured that all metrics are completely anonymous and no sensitive information is transmitted. However, if you still wish to disable telemetry, you have the option to do so by:
* Setting the environment variable `TELEMETRY=0`
* Or setting `telemetry = 0` in the section `searchd` of your configuration file

Here is a list of all the metrics we collect:

## Backup metrics

The Manticore backup tool sends anonymized metrics to the Manticore metrics server by default in order to help improve the product. If you don't want to send telemetry, you can disable it by running the tool with the `--disable-metric` flag or by setting the environment variable `TELEMETRY=0`.
