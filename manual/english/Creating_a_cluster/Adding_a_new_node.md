# Adding a new node

To add a new node to a cluster, simply start another instance of Manticore and ensure that it is accessible by the other nodes in the cluster. Connect the new node to the rest of the cluster using a [distributed table](../Creating_a_table/Creating_a_distributed_table/Creating_a_distributed_table.md) and ensure data safety with [replication](../Creating_a_cluster/Setting_up_replication/Setting_up_replication.md).
