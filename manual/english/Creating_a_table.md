# Creating a table
<!-- proofread -->

Manticore Search offers several ways to create tables, each designed for different use cases and requirements. This section covers the main approaches and their specific configurations.

## Table Types

Manticore supports different types of tables:

- **Real-time tables** - For real-time updates and immediate searchability
- **Plain tables** - For static data that doesn't require frequent updates
- **Percolate tables** - For storing and matching search queries
- **Template tables** - For creating table templates
- **Distributed tables** - For scaling across multiple nodes

## Key Components

When creating a table, you'll need to consider:

1. **Data Types** - Understanding the available data types and their storage options
2. **NLP and Tokenization** - Configuring how your text data is processed and indexed
3. **Table Structure** - Defining the schema and settings for your specific use case

## Getting Started

To create a table, you'll need to:

1. Choose the appropriate table type for your use case
2. Define the table schema with the required fields and attributes
3. Configure the necessary settings for your specific requirements
