# Attaching one table to another

<!-- example Example_1 -->

A plain table can be converted into a real-time table or added to an existing real-time table.

The first case is useful when you need to regenerate a real-time table completely, which may be needed, for example, if tokenization settings need an update. In this situation, preparing a plain table and converting it into a real-time table may be easier than preparing a batch job to perform INSERTs for adding all the data into a real-time table.

In the second case, you normally want to add a large bulk of new data to a real-time table, and again, creating a plain table with that data is easier than populating the existing real-time table.

You can also attach an existing real-time table to another one.

##### Attaching table - general syntax
The `ATTACH` statement allows you to convert a plain table to be attached to an existing real-time table. It also enables you to attach the content of one real-time table to another real-time table.

```sql
ATTACH TABLE plain_or_rt_table TO TABLE rt_table [WITH TRUNCATE]
```

After a successful `ATTACH` the data originally stored in the source plain table becomes a part of the target RT table, and the source plain table becomes unavailable (until the next rebuild). If the source table is an RT table, its content is moved into the destination RT table, and the source RT table remains empty. `ATTACH` does not result in any table data changes. Essentially, it just renames the files (making the source table a new disk chunk of the target RT table) and updates the metadata. So it is generally a quick operation that might (frequently) complete as fast as under a second.

Note that when a table is attached to an empty RT table, the fields, attributes, and text processing settings (tokenizer, wordforms, etc.) from the *source* table are copied over and take effect. The respective parts of the RT table definition from the configuration file will be ignored.

When the `TRUNCATE` option is used, the RT table gets truncated prior to attaching the source plain table. This allows the operation to be atomic or ensures that the attached source plain table will be the only data in the target RT table.

`ATTACH TABLE` comes with a number of restrictions. Most notably, the target RT table is currently required to be either empty or have the same settings as the source table. In case the source table gets attached to a non-empty RT table, the RT table data collected so far gets stored as a regular disk chunk, and the table being attached becomes the newest disk chunk, with documents having the same IDs getting killed. The complete list of restrictions is as follows:
* The target RT table needs to be either empty or have the same settings as the source table.
* The source table needs to have [phrase_boundary_step](../../../Creating_a_table/NLP_and_tokenization/Low-level_tokenization.md#phrase_boundary_step) set to 0 and [stopword_step](../../../Creating_a_table/NLP_and_tokenization/Ignoring_stop-words.md#stopword_step) set to 1.

##### Example:

<!-- request Example -->
Before the ATTACH, the RT table is empty and has 3 fields:

```sql
mysql> DESC rt;
Empty set (0.00 sec)

mysql> SELECT * FROM rt;
+-----------+---------+
| Field     | Type    |
+-----------+---------+
| id        | integer |
| testfield | field   |
| testattr  | uint    |
+-----------+---------+
3 rows in set (0.00 sec)
```

The plain table is not empty:

```sql
mysql> SELECT * FROM plain WHERE MATCH('test');
+------+--------+----------+------------+
| id   | weight | group_id | date_added |
+------+--------+----------+------------+
|    1 |   1304 |        1 | 1313643256 |
|    2 |   1304 |        1 | 1313643256 |
|    3 |   1304 |        1 | 1313643256 |
|    4 |   1304 |        1 | 1313643256 |
+------+--------+----------+------------+
4 rows in set (0.00 sec)
```

Attaching the plain table to the RT table:
```sql
mysql> ATTACH TABLE plain TO TABLE rt;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)
```

The RT table now has 5 fields:

```sql
mysql> DESC rt;
+------------+-----------+
| Field      | Type      |
+------------+-----------+
| id         | integer   |
| title      | field     |
| content    | field     |
| group_id   | uint      |
| date_added | timestamp |
+------------+-----------+
5 rows in set (0.00 sec)
```

And it's not empty:

```sql
mysql> SELECT * FROM rt WHERE MATCH('test');
+------+--------+----------+------------+
| id   | weight | group_id | date_added |
+------+--------+----------+------------+
|    1 |   1304 |        1 | 1313643256 |
|    2 |   1304 |        1 | 1313643256 |
|    3 |   1304 |        1 | 1313643256 |
|    4 |   1304 |        1 | 1313643256 |
+------+--------+----------+------------+
4 rows in set (0.00 sec)
```

After the ATTACH, the plain table is removed and no longer available for searching:

```sql
mysql> SELECT * FROM plain WHERE MATCH('test');
ERROR 1064 (42000): no enabled local indexes to search
```
