# Searching and ranking functions

### BM25A()
`BM25A(k1,b)` returns the exact `BM25A()` value. Requires the `expr` ranker and enabled `index_field_lengths`. Parameters `k1` and `b` must be floats.

### BM25F()
`BM25F(k1, b, {field=weight, ...})` returns the exact `BM25F()` value and requires `index_field_lengths` to be enabled. The `expr` ranker is also necessary. Parameters `k1` and `b` must be floats.

### EXIST()
Substitutes non-existent columns with default values. It returns either the value of an attribute specified by 'attr-name', or the 'default-value' if that attribute does not exist. STRING or MVA attributes are not supported. This function is useful when searching through multiple tables with different schemas.

```sql
SELECT *, EXIST('gid', 6) as cnd FROM i1, i2 WHERE cnd>5
```

### MIN_TOP_SORTVAL()
Returns the sort key value of the worst-ranked element in the current top-N matches if the sort key is a float, and 0 otherwise.

### MIN_TOP_WEIGHT()
Returns the weight of the worst-ranked element in the current top-N matches.

### PACKEDFACTORS()
`PACKEDFACTORS()` can be used in queries to display all calculated weighting factors during matching or to provide a binary attribute for creating a custom ranking UDF. This function only works if the expression ranker is specified and the query is not a full scan; otherwise, it returns an error. `PACKEDFACTORS()` can take an optional argument that disables ATC ranking factor calculation: `PACKEDFACTORS({no_atc=1})`. Calculating ATC significantly slows down query processing, so this option can be useful if you need to see the ranking factors but don't require ATC. `PACKEDFACTORS()` can also output in JSON format: `PACKEDFACTORS({json=1})`. The respective outputs in either key-value pair or JSON format are shown below. (Note that the examples below are wrapped for readability; actual returned values would be single-line.)

```sql
mysql> SELECT id, PACKEDFACTORS() FROM test1
    -> WHERE MATCH('test one') OPTION ranker=expr('1') \G
*************************** 1\. row ***************************
             id: 1

This function can be used to implement custom ranking functions in UDFs, as in:

```sql
SELECT *, CUSTOM_RANK(PACKEDFACTORS()) AS r
FROM my_index
WHERE match('hello')
ORDER BY r DESC
OPTION ranker=expr('1');
```

Where `CUSTOM_RANK()` is a function implemented in a UDF. It should declare a `SPH_UDF_FACTORS` structure (defined in sphinxudf.h), initialize this structure, unpack the factors into it before usage, and deinitialize it afterwards, as follows:

```sql
SPH_UDF_FACTORS factors;
sphinx_factors_init(&factors);
sphinx_factors_unpack((DWORD*)args->arg_values[0], &factors);
// ... can use the contents of factors variable here ...
sphinx_factors_deinit(&factors);
```

`PACKEDFACTORS()` data is available at all query stages, not just during the initial matching and ranking pass. This enables another particularly interesting application of `PACKEDFACTORS()`: re-ranking.

In the example above, we used an expression-based ranker with a dummy expression and sorted the result set by the value computed by our UDF. In other words, we used the UDF to rank all our results. Now, let's assume for the sake of an example that our UDF is extremely expensive to compute, with a throughput of only 10,000 calls per second. If our query matches 1,000,000 documents, we would want to use a much simpler expression to do most of our ranking in order to maintain reasonable performance. Then, we would apply the expensive UDF to only a few top results, say, the top 100 results. In other words, we would build the top 100 results using a simpler ranking function and then re-rank those with a more complex one. This can be done with subselects:

```sql
SELECT * FROM (
    SELECT *, CUSTOM_RANK(PACKEDFACTORS()) AS r
    FROM my_index WHERE match('hello')
    OPTION ranker=expr('sum(lcs)*1000+bm25')
    ORDER BY WEIGHT() DESC
    LIMIT 100
) ORDER BY r DESC LIMIT 10
```

In this example, the expression-based ranker is called for every matched document to compute `WEIGHT()`, so it gets called 1,000,000 times. However, the UDF computation can be postponed until the outer sort, and it will only be performed for the top 100 matches by `WEIGHT()`, according to the inner limit. This means the UDF will only be called 100 times. Finally, the top 10 matches by UDF value are selected and returned to the application.

For reference, in a distributed setup, the `PACKEDFACTORS()` data is sent from the agents to the master node in binary format. This makes it technically feasible to implement additional re-ranking passes on the master node if needed.

When used in SQL but not called from any UDFs, the result of `PACKEDFACTORS()` is formatted as plain text, which can be used to manually assess the ranking factors. Note that this feature is not currently supported by the Manticore API.


### REMOVE_REPEATS()
`REMOVE_REPEATS ( result_set, column, offset, limit )` - removes repeated adjusted rows with the same 'column' value.

```sql
SELECT REMOVE_REPEATS((SELECT * FROM dist1), gid, 0, 10)
```
Note that `REMOVE_REPEATS` does not affect `total_found` in the [search query meta info](../../Node_info_and_management/SHOW_META.md#SHOW-META).

### WEIGHT()
The `WEIGHT()` function returns the calculated matching score. If no ordering is specified, the result is sorted in descending order by the score provided by `WEIGHT()`. In this example, we order first by weight and then by an integer attribute.

The search above performs a simple matching, where all words need to be present. However, we can do more (and this is just a simple example):

```sql
mysql> SELECT *,WEIGHT() FROM testrt WHERE MATCH('"list of business laptops"/3');
+------+------+-------------------------------------+---------------------------+----------+
| id   | gid  | title                               | content                   | weight() |
+------+------+-------------------------------------+---------------------------+----------+
|    1 |   10 | List of HP business laptops         | Elitebook Probook         |     2397 |
|    2 |   10 | List of Dell business laptops       | Latitude Precision Vostro |     2397 |
|    3 |   20 | List of Dell gaming laptops         | Inspirion Alienware       |     2375 |
|    5 |   30 | List of ASUS ultrabooks and laptops | Zenbook Vivobook          |     2375 |
+------+------+-------------------------------------+---------------------------+----------+
4 rows in set (0.00 sec)


mysql> SHOW META;
+----------------+----------+
| Variable_name  | Value    |
+----------------+----------+
| total          | 4        |
| total_found    | 4        |
| total_relation | eq       |
| time           | 0.000    |
| keyword[0]     | list     |
| docs[0]        | 5        |
| hits[0]        | 5        |
| keyword[1]     | of       |
| docs[1]        | 4        |
| hits[1]        | 4        |
| keyword[2]     | business |
| docs[2]        | 2        |
| hits[2]        | 2        |
| keyword[3]     | laptops  |
| docs[3]        | 5        |
| hits[3]        | 5        |
+----------------+----------+
16 rows in set (0.00 sec)
```

Here, we search for four words, but a match can occur even if only three of the four words are found. The search will rank documents containing all words higher.

### ZONESPANLIST()
The `ZONESPANLIST()` function returns pairs of matched zone spans. Each pair contains the matched zone span identifier, a colon, and the order number of the matched zone span. For example, if a document reads `<emphasis role="bold"><i>text</i> the <i>text</i></emphasis>`, and you query for `'ZONESPAN:(i,b) text'`, then `ZONESPANLIST()` will return the string `"1:1 1:2 2:1"`, meaning that the first zone span matched "text" in spans 1 and 2, and the second zone span in span 1 only.

### QUERY()
`QUERY()` returns the current search query. `QUERY()` is a postlimit expression and is intended to be used with [SNIPPET()](../Functions/String_functions.md#SNIPPET%28%29).

Table functions are a mechanism for post-query result set processing. Table functions take an arbitrary result set as input and return a new, processed set as output. The first argument should be the input result set, but a table function can optionally take and handle more arguments. Table functions can completely change the result set, including the schema. Currently, only built-in table functions are supported. Table functions work for both outer `SELECT` and [nested SELECT](../Searching/Sub-selects.md).
