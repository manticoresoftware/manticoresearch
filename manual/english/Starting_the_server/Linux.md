# Starting Manticore in Linux

### Starting and stopping using systemd

After the installation the Manticore Search service is not started automatically. To start Manticore run the following command:

```shell
sudo systemctl start manticore
```

To stop Manticore run the following command:

```shell
sudo systemctl stop manticore
```

The Manticore service is set to run at boot. You can check it by running:

```shell
sudo systemctl is-enabled manticore
```

If you want to disable Manticore from starting at boot time, run:

```bash
sudo systemctl disable manticore
```

To make Manticore start at boot, run:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable manticore
```

`searchd` process logs startup information in `systemd` journal. If `systemd` logging is enabled you can view the logged information with the following command:

```shell
sudo journalctl -u manticore
```

### Custom startup flags using systemd

`systemctl set-environment _ADDITIONAL_SEARCHD_PARAMS`  allows you to specify custom startup flags that the Manticore Search daemon should be started with. See full list [here](../Starting_the_server/Manually.md#searchd-command-line-options).

For example, to start Manticore with the debug logging level, you can run:
```bash
systemctl set-environment _ADDITIONAL_SEARCHD_PARAMS='--logdebug'
systemctl restart manticore
```

To undo it, run:
```bash
systemctl set-environment _ADDITIONAL_SEARCHD_PARAMS=''
systemctl restart manticore
```

Note, systemd environment variables get reset on server reboot.

### Starting and stopping using service

Manticore can be started and stopped using service commands:

```shell
sudo service manticore start
sudo service manticore stop
```

To enable the sysV service at boot on RedHat systems run:

```shell
chkconfig manticore on
```

To enable the sysV service at boot on Debian systems (including Ubuntu) run:

```shell
update-rc.d manticore defaults
```

Please note that `searchd` is started by the init system under the `manticore` user and all files created by the server will be owned by this user. If `searchd` is started under, for example, the root user, the file permissions will be changed, which may result in issues when running `searchd` as a service again.
