# memory limit
# can be specified in bytes, kilobytes (mem_limit=1000K) or megabytes (mem_limit=10M)
# will grow if set unacceptably low
# will warn if set too low, hurting the performance
# optional, default if 32M
mem_limit			= 32M


# data source type
# for now, known types are 'mysql' and 'xmlpipe'
# MUST be defined

										# usually '/tmp/mysql.sock' on FreeBSD

# useful eg. to setup encoding or mark records

# main document fetch query
# you can specify any number of fields
#
# document_id MUST be the very first field
# document_id MUST be positive (non-zero, non-negative)
# document_id MUST fit into 32 bits
#
# mandatory
sql_query			= \
	SELECT id, group, date, title, data \
	FROM documents doc


# query range setup
#
# useful to avoid MyISAM table locks and big result sets
# when indexing lots of data
#
# to use query ranges, you should
# 1) provide a query to fetch min and max id (ie. id range) from data set;
# 2) configure step size in which this range will be walked;
# 3) use $start and $end macros somewhere in the main fetch query.
#
# 'sql_query_range' must return exactly two integer fields
# in exactly min_id, max_id order
#
# 'sql_range_step' must be a positive integer
# optional, default is 1024
#
# 'sql_query' must contain both '$start' and '$end' macros
# if you are using query ranges (because it obviously would be an
# error to index the whole table many times)
#
# note that the intervals specified by $start/$end do not
# overlap, so you should NOT remove document ids which are exactly
# equal to $start or $end in your query
#
# here's an example which will index 'documents' table
# fetching (at most) one thousand entries at a time:
#
# sql_query_range		= SELECT MIN(id),MAX(id) FROM documents
# sql_range_step		= 1000
# sql_query			= \
#	SELECT doc.id, doc.id AS group, doc.title, doc.data \
#	FROM documents doc \
#	WHERE id>=$start AND id<=$end


# group_id and date column names or numbers
# these fields MUST be positive (non-zero, non-negative) integers
# these fields MUST fit into 32 bits
#
# columns are numbered starting from 1, ie. document_id is 1, next one is 2, etc
# if any of the columns is configured, it's removed from fulltext indexed fields,
# therefore changing the field numbering
#
# for instance, in this example configuration, 'title' column will
# number 1 and 'data' column will be number 2, because id/group/date
# columns are removed
#
# optional, default is empty
sql_group_column	= group
sql_date_column		= date

# by index:
#
# sql_group_column	= 2
# sql_group_column	= 3


# post-query, executed after the main fetch query
# useful eg. to unmark records
# optional, default is empty
sql_query_post		=

# demo config for 'xmlpipe' source type is a little below
# with xmlpipe, sphinx opens a pipe to a given command, and reads documents from stdin
#
# sphinx expects one or more documents from xmlpipe stdin
# each document must be formatted as follows:
#
# <document>
# <id>123</id>
# <group>1</group>
# <title>test title</title>
# <body>
# this is my document body
# </body>
# </document>
