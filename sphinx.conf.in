# demo config for 'xmlpipe' source type is a little below
# with xmlpipe, sphinx opens a pipe to a given command, and reads documents from stdin
#
# sphinx expects one or more documents from xmlpipe stdin
# each document must be formatted as follows:
#
# <document>
# <id>123</id>
# <group>1</group>
# <title>test title</title>
# <body>
# this is my document body
# </body>
# </document>
