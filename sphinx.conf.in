	# query range setup
	#
	# useful to avoid MyISAM table locks and big result sets
	# when indexing lots of data
	#
	# to use query ranges, you should
	# 1) provide a query to fetch min and max id (ie. id range) from data set;
	# 2) configure step size in which this range will be walked;
	# 3) use $start and $end macros somewhere in the main fetch query.
	#
	# 'sql_query_range' must return exactly two integer fields
	# in exactly min_id, max_id order
	#
	# 'sql_range_step' must be a positive integer
	# optional, default is 1024
	#
	# 'sql_query' must contain both '$start' and '$end' macros
	# if you are using query ranges (because it obviously would be an
	# error to index the whole table many times)
	#
	# note that the intervals specified by $start/$end do not
	# overlap, so you should NOT remove document ids which are exactly
	# equal to $start or $end in your query
	#
	# here's an example which will index 'documents' table
	# fetching (at most) one thousand entries at a time:
	#
	# sql_query_range		= SELECT MIN(id),MAX(id) FROM documents
	# sql_range_step		= 1000
	# sql_query			= \
	#	SELECT doc.id, doc.id AS group, doc.title, doc.data \
	#	FROM documents doc \
	#	WHERE id>=$start AND id<=$end


	# group_id and date column names or numbers
	# these fields MUST be positive (non-zero, non-negative) integers
	# these fields MUST fit into 32 bits
	#
	# columns are numbered starting from 1, ie. document_id is 1, next one is 2, etc
	# if any of the columns is configured, it's removed from fulltext indexed fields,
	# therefore changing the field numbering
	#
	# for instance, in this example configuration, 'title' column will
	# number 1 and 'data' column will be number 2, because id/group/date
	# columns are removed
	#
	# optional, default is empty
	sql_group_column	= group_id
	sql_date_column		= date_added

	# an example of specifying group/timestamp columns by index:
	#
	# sql_group_column	= 2
	# sql_date_column	= 3

	# useful eg. to unmark records
	# optional, default is empty
	sql_query_post		=


	# post-index-query, executed after the indexing is succesfully completed
	# $maxid macro is available, which is the max document ID actually fetched from DB
	# optional, default is empty
	#
	# sql_query_post_index = REPLACE INTO counters ( id, val ) VALUES ( 'max_indexed_id', $maxid )


	# document info query

# this is a virtual index which can NOT be directly indexed,

#
# 1) connects to all the specified remote agents,
# 2) issues the query,
# 3) searches local indexes (while the remote agents are searching),
# 4) collects remote search results,
# 5) merges all the results together (removing the duplicates),
# 6) sends the merged resuls to client.
#
# this index type is primarily intenteded to be able to split huge (100GB+)
# datasets into chunks placed on different physical servers and them search
# through those chunks in parallel, reducing response times and server load;
# it seems, however, that it could also be used to take advantage of
# multi-processor systems or to implement HA (high-availability) search.
