// in MatchIterator_c we need matches sorted assending by DocID.
// also we don't want to sort matches themselves; sorted vec of indexes quite enough
// also we wont to avoid allocating vec for the matches as it may be huge.
// There are several possible solutions to have vec of indexes:
// 1. Use matches tags, as they're not used in this part of code. With intensive working it is however not a good in
// terms of cache misses (i.e. 'min' match is match[N] where N is match[0].tag, then match[M] where M is match[1] tag.
// So each time we make about random jumps.
// 2. Use space between last match and end of the vector (assuming reserved space > used space). If it is enough space,
// we can use it either as vec or WORDS, or as vec or DWORDS, depending from N of matches. First case need at most 128K
// of RAM, second needs more, but that RAM is compact.
// So, let's try with tail space first, but if it is not available (no, or not enough space), use tags.
