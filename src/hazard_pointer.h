// Hazard pointers implementation
/*
 * Main idea: as long as somebody uses an object, we should not delete it.
 * To achieve it, two things in use:
 * 1. When we have to delete an object, we call hazard::Retire, providing pointer to the obj,
 *    or raw (void*) ptr and deleter function which has to be called with that ptr for cleaning.
 * 2. When access obj from the other thread by pointer, we access it via Guard_c::Protect.
 *    It ensures, that pointer is saved in thread-local set of hazard pointers.
 *
 * At the moment when thread-local list of retired object full, we collect all hazard pointers from all threads
 * and then filter our list of retired: if an object is not pointed by anyone, it is finally removed.
 *
 * Since hazard pointer protection intended for local variables only, just few hazard slots provided for each object
 * (usually 1 or 2 is enough).
 *
 * Since hazard pointer is thread-local, avoid switch context having some variable protected this way,
 * since yielding in one thread and awaking in another will lead to race of hazard pointer in original thread,
 * and since it is hot place, we want to keep it simpler (avoid any mt-related problem).
 *
 * RAII wrapper hazard::Ptr_T
 *
 * Comparing to ref-counting, hazard pointers are faster, since uses just light atomic store for saving pointers,
 * and avoids heavy compare-and-swap as used in atomic counters.
 *
