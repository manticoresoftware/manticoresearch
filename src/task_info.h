/*
 * Lowest info came from thread. It includes low details as thread name, thread ID and basic profile statistic.
 *
 * When a task engaged into thread, we also have details about the task, like connection id, proto, etc.
 * OR, for system task - the name of the action.
 *
 * Task may produce subtasks - like parallel processing rt chunks, and they also include details like current chunk N.
 * It may be any kind of different pieces of data, coming from different subtasks, and each need to be processed
 * different way, depends on the essence of the data itself.
 *
 * When task engaged, it fills its own TaskInfo structure with its essential data, and stores it in the
 * field m_pTaskInfo of thread descriptor LowThreadDesc_t. Previous value of that field stored in task's m_pNext field.
 * So, moving deep from task to task we finally have linked list of task infos, starting from one stored in Thread
 * and moving forward with m_pNext pointers.
 *
 * Each piece lives in own context (task) and owned by the task.
 * For displaying data (in show threads) we have 'public thread descriptor' with plain structure and fixed fields
 * Filling of that structure from low thread descriptor performed by GatherPublicThreadsInfo. It first copies low thread
 * attributes, and then walk over task info chains, collecting essential data.
 *
 * Each task info has TaskType flag, and provides function which publish essential data into public descriptor.
 * When unwinding task chain we look for the type and call saved function, if any.
 * If no 'displaying' func provided, we just skip to the next layer.
