Main query, which needs to fetch all the documents, can impose a read lock on the 
whole table and stall the concurrent queries (eg. INSERTs to MyISAM table), waste 
a lot of memory for result set, etc. To avoid this, Sphinx supports so-called <em 
class=\"glossterm\">ranged queries</em>. With ranged queries, Sphinx first fetches 
min and max document IDs from the table, and then substitutes different ID intervals 
into main query text and runs the modified query to fetch another chunk of documents.
